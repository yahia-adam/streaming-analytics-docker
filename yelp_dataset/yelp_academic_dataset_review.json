I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house.\nThe vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.\nMy daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea.

As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated\/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn't be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \n\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4\/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant\/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.","date":1425526674000}

That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late).

The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\n\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup\/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \n\nThe salad\/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \n\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \n\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.","date":1464660894000}

WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of \"tree huggers\" and \"earth children\", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop.

Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons\/pros:\n\n- We were staying a nearby hotel.\n- The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule.\n- If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away.\n- $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard!\n- They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go.\n- Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.\n\nNow I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.\n\n- We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents\/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...\n- The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go. \n- Clean the bathroom!!\n\nWill probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.","date":1483330337000}

Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.\n\nTheir menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients.

Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up. \n\nBut over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:  \n\nThe Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. \n\nThe fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries\n\nThe onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). \n\nSpanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good\n\nBaklava - VERY GOOD! \n\nSignature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!\n\nThe (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it. \n\nOverall, this place is great! Provided they don't stray from the high quality standard they are setting, I will keep going back.","date":1333141049000}

The property is located very close to the airport but you really don't hear it.  The rooms are standard TownePlace Suite rooms with a refrigerator, stove, etc..

The staff of the hotel was really friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is standard continental with a couple of hot options. They also have a reception on weekday evenings.  My only complaint is that the food and drink go quickly so get there early.  You could use this as a dinner if you wanted.

Since I couldnt decide and the sandwiches werent too expensive at $6.85, I got the roast beef and roast port combos.\n\nI got my two sandwiches fast enough, but the roast beef was cold and the roast pork was hot.  Not sure how a cook (for lack of a better word) could serve 2 things at the same time with such a temperature differential, one was obviously sitting for awhile.  I asked the waitress to reheat the roast beef while I finished the roast pork, and supposedly it was reheated, since it was warmer, but it was still cold-ish compared to my roast pork I had just finished.  The waitress did offer to replace it when she inquired, but I was in a hurry and didnt really care for a hot version of this sandwich.\n\nThe sandwiches were very skimpy on meat, but they \"made up for it\" by adding too much gravy to make it overly messy and the bread was disintegrating.  The menu place card mentions the \"wet meat\" option where you get less gravy, I strongly recommend you get it that style, especially if the gravy overpower the meat and structural integrity of the sandwich.","date":1415796089000}

It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  \n\nThe property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  \n\nRoom: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200\/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  \n\nCheckout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.","date":1375547208000}

They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w\/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!\n\nDessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea.

Over the years I've purchased many items from here and I can attest that they do last a long time (about a year, year and a half, including some stuff I use often!). I see all kind of specialty salts for example (onion salt, celery salt) as well as sugars and powders (lavender vanilla sugar, vanilla bean powder). Their products even seem to taste fresher (I can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what I can get at a dollar store, for example). The prices aren't too bad and they last long.

He is that good. The couple of times that I've strayed, I have been severely disappointed in the outcome. But I wasn't planning a trip back to Austin for a while and badly needed a cut, so I decided to bite the bullet.\n\nMy friend walks in a few weeks ago with *srsly* the cutest short hair cut. And so I ask her who and where, and she says Rodney Mitchell. I figured that this place would be too expensive, but she corrected my thinking on the matter. So I called to make an appointment with her guy (whose name I sadly cannot remember at the moment) and Rodney answered the phone. Turns out the guy my friend had seen didn't do morning appointments and all my afternoons were filled, so Rodney said \"look, I'm the owner, I can absolutely vouch for Allison who has several openings in the next few days.\" So I thought, alright, he's the owner so he knows his stuff--I'll do it.\n\nAllison absolutely did not disappoint. First off, she's a total sweetheart, but not super chatty (I appreciate stylists who can be content to both hold and not hold a convo while working) so there was no pressure there. I came in with my laptop and several photos I'd found that approximated what I wanted in a haircut, as I couldn't find exactly the right one. We talked about it a bit, discussed front and back length, bangs, etc. and she said alright and went to it. What she gave me was the cutest damn shaggy bob that I never thought possible. I seriously can't wait to go back.\n\nOne of the other awesome things about RMS is that they give you a discount for your first visit and I believe they have some kind of discount for students and teachers. They also will give you *another* discount when you refer people. So I got my friend a discount, and then referred a friend, so I'll get another discount when I go back for my next cut.

When I asked for it to be turned down, they told me they can't--it just plays at one level all the time, and the speakers  are everywhere so you can't get away from it. It sucks.\n\nSecondly, if you're a tea drinker, you're out of luck. They don't serve the tea in pots, but huge, sloppy individual filters--it makes your beverage totally ungainly, hard to drink and is really off putting.\n\nPros: gluten free goodies and yummy Italian sodas.

This time it was El Sabor Poblano on Federal, which could not look less special if it tried.\n\nI liked that there were 3 fish tacos on the menu.  I picked the fried and battered version, though the tortilla chip covered fish could have been awesome. I was instantly impressed when I opened one of my three and found that El Sabor puts an entire filet of fish in each taco! The flakey meat had no fishy taste. These tacos came with the more American toppings of lettuce and, tomato, and cheese. I bet I could have gotten cilantro and onion if I asked. The sole staff member in the place seemed happy to accommodate us- well, we were the only ones dining in.\n\nAnother taco filling option that comes with more traditional toppings is the super crispy chorizo, only $8 for 3. There was no detectable gristle here, something I have often come across at this little places.\n\nAs unassuming as it looks, this particular South Philly Mexican place is worth stopping by.","date":1414424357000}

One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn't have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they'd stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don't you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn't come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders, so seriously, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone, it's their turf.  They can smoke, fart, vomit on themselves, if I don't like it I can leave.  But if I'm there, it's my turf.  Don't come sit next to me and smoke, fart, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh, you don't like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.  Your life revovles around throwing away your pension money in a mindless electronic game of cards and killing yourself with carcinogens and toxins, well go kill yourself in private, seriously.  You don't see me walking up to a bar and slitting my wrists and burning my money.  It's gross.  I probably just realized this, but I really enjoy Cin Cin not only because they have the best cocktails in town, but they have no machines at the bar.  Peppermill, if you want to create a cool cocktail bar, ditch the machines, train your staff, or hire bartenders with better service skills, and buy some independent liquors.","date":1375577040000}

I was in NJ early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast.  I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  \n\nThe egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.\n\nThe pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.\n\nThe server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).  Bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts.\n\nAll around, I loved this place and hope to go back soon.  Long live the Jersey diners!","date":1361479205000}

I can't vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu, but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal. I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking, during which time Brian, the owner, came out and talked to us, comped us a drink, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. \n\nI kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids. I think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment. We went back for drinks before and after the concert. It got very crowded but we still received excellent food, drinks and service.

A wonderful outdoor patio,  couldn't have a nicer setting to enjoy your tasting....   The staff were super, super nice,  I would give them an A+!  \n\nSo why only three stars?  It is because of the wine club!  Very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as HELL with the benefits to the members..   Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.   If I come with my wife once a month we wouldn't even be covered... let alone if we bring a guest!   \n\nSo go to this winery if you want to enjoy a tasting in one of the most beautiful settings on earth.

We had a problem where Monro Muffler underfilled our engine by 3 quarts of oil and caused damage to the engine. Monro's insurance company said they would pay for damages if we brought to the dealer, we were frequent customers of Bergeys so we brought it here. They discovered the timing chain needed to be replaced, a chain that lasts the life of the car unless you don't change the oil or have low oil pressure the tensioner can lock and stretch the chain. Joe the service associate that took the car in specifically said I told the insurance company as little as possible and told them he couldn't tell if it was from the oil and there was no way to tell. And on top of that, was extremely rude and unprofessional to my wife bringing her to tears the way he spoke to her. My wife and I just bought a house in the area, only 26 years old and you lost a life long customer. Over the past year we spent about $7000 in repairs here, and Joe went out of his way to be unhelpful and leave us in a terrible spot.

It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration. \n\nWe had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.\n\nIt was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention. \n\nAfter getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...). \n\nAfter ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. \n\nOnce our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. \n\nThey finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...\n\nIn summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous. \n\nI really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and I hate writing such a negative review, but I had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype.","date":1504915755000}

Everybody here raves about the restaurants, but I have yet to find many that deserve five stars, or even four.  This is the best restaurant I have eaten in in Philadelphia.  \n\nTahini and bread  arrived at the table, and I thought, hum, plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.\n\nI love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly, the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one\n\nMy husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.\n\nI was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.\n\nOur service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom, the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really, but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.  \n\nMy eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive, though appropriately priced restaurant.  Kudos to the chef.","date":1375544055000}

I kept my countenance, and we ordered a round. Things proceeded as expected ... unwanted dance grinding advances, check! uber drunk guy talking your ear off, check! Big Buck Hunter, CHECK!!!

Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature's beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the \"wrong\" thing (cioppino). That wasn't very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. \n\nWe came for a late lunch\/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn't ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. \n\nWe got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!\n\nWe also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)\n\nThe ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!\n\nBy the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier.

He also stated that the very few parking spots in front were free* only on the weekend.\n\nThe Room: This wasn't a room, this was an apartment and I absolutely loved it. It was very spacious and had everything I sought* after for that weekend, such as: fully stocked kitchen, a desk, lots of space, king bed, huge table, nice living room, lots of closets. My only complaint is that I could not open any windows for fresh air...they are nailed\/screwed shut. There was also a small welcome bag w cookies and water and papers letting you know where all the food delivery locations and numbers.\nThere wasn't maid service knocking loudly or trying to barge in early in the morning. This place is more of a long term setting and I'm sure the maids come around during the week Monday-Friday if you desire. I was only here for 3 days and I was fine with that. I went shopping at Shoprite and filled my fridge with water and breakfast to cook.\n\nOverall: This place is awesome, I had a huge living room to entertain my guests when they visited, and a nice desk to study my Anatomy notes.

Super bummed and still in the mood for barbecue, we started wandering around Mid City and my trusty Yelp app guided me to this place. We were greeted by the super nice woman working the counter and she explained the whole process.\n\nI decided to get the one-meat plate with \"wet\" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,\n\nWe both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything.

Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern. \n\nThe layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need. \n\nThough they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well. \n\nOur group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, ni\u00e7oise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken. \n\nAll the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets. \n\nWe settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet). With the added drinks and tip it came out to under $35 a person, which is an excellent price for such a delicious white-linen lunch. No matter the size of my group, I will definitely be returning!","date":1273875681000}

You can pretty much get whatever your heart desires. I've had mac n cheese patties on my burger, you can get a bison burger, turkey burger, literally anything. I have tried a ton and have never been let down by the flavor combinations. The waiters are always super honest, in a good way.

You can get Classic American food in many categories prepared fresh and delicious with great care and attention to detail that is lacking in common chain restaurants.  You can also get traditional Turkish cuisine that is the very best kebab that I ever had.  Rosemary's is a family owned business and they treat you like you are part of that family.  We are making Rosemary's our Saturday night place.  last weekend my wife and I took my. Mother in law to Rosemary's Grill for dinner.  It was even better that the time before.  I tried the Mixed grill kebab platter.  Lamb, Chicken, Adana, and gyro kebab meats, so tender and expertly spiced and grilled, along with a shepherds salad, grilled half tomatoes, rice, and of course flat bread.  The Adana kebab was particularly tender, juicy, and tasty.  I had never had Adana kebab before and will be ordering it again.  I shared a taste with my Mother in law and she loved it too!  mom in law had crab cakes and she enjoyed them very much.  My wife had the French onion soup, which she raves about and always orders.  She also had the roast turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and corn.  She loved everything on that platter.  She commented that the gravy was especially good.  The portion sizes are huge and we love to have the left overs again at home.  I have honestly not been to a restaurant in the area that has such good quality in all there entrees, sides, salad bar, and drinks, and you have to try the rice pudding.  We have eaten a few times here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and it continues to be our very favorite place.  The waitstaff and owners make you feel right at home and are warm, welcoming, and friendly.  I can not say enough good things.  \n\nSent from my iPad","date":1393240427000}

Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn't get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.\n\nI purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn't my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out. \n\nAfter sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn't something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn't be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my \"finished car\" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield. \n\nAfter all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that's the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we've been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said \"I don't know\" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got \"I don't know\". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get \"serviced\". \n\nInvest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process. Not a good look on managements part.","date":1399556499000}

Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.\n\nWhy do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.\n\nLets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.\n\nRound out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. \n\nWash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.\n\nThough Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.","date":1384392183000}

Big portions at decent prices. You won't leave hungry!\n\nAnd now for a full review:\n\nI have been to this Fellini's Cafe and the one in Bryn Mawr several times and each time I've visited there have been some memorable moments...and there have been speed bumps that keep this place from reaching its full potential.\n\nOn my latest visit this past Friday night, I made reservations for 730. My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.\n\nBeing out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.\n\nThe interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.\n\nOur waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.\n\nFor dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.\n\nComplimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). \n\nOverall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: \n\n1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.\n\n2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.\n\nWhen we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.\n\nAll in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.","date":1342459656000}

I visited Stitch-It in June 2013\n\nIn brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased.  I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn't mind paying a premium.  The service and results far exceeded my expectations.\n\nComplete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn't have time to get it tailored before leaving.  I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It.  I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn't give me the warm and fuzzies.  \n\nStitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor\/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said \"I can hem the bottom....I'd have to do it by hand.  The top part though....I won't touch that with a 10ft. pole!\"  I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done.  \n\nI contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who's name I can't remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong).  They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It.  When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  My personal tailor was Maggie O'Neill and she was AWESOME!  After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days.  It fit perfectly and was well worth the fee.  If I lived in Nashville, I would DEFINITELY use Stitch-It on a regular basis.","date":1401126835000}

However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.\n\nThe service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager\/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  \n\nThe food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  \n\nI am a fan!  This place doesn't quite hit all the marks of Buffalo-Inspired food, but it does a pretty good job of putting a southern twist on chicken fingers!","date":1502898711000}

It is just across the street from 30th Street Station, and just down the street from Drexel University.  We we able to get street parking about 2 blocks down the street, so that is always a plus.  \n\nService was sufficient for dinner.  We tried the mac and cheese appetizer that had just the right amount of breadcrumbs on it.  It was served hot, but with average taste.  We also tried the cheeseteak egg rolls - decent, but not a lot of meat in them.  Some of the bites I had of the egg roll were merely the fried dough without getting to any of the cheese and meat.   They were served with ketchup and a special mustard that had some horseradish in it for a bit of a kick!  I must say, it is a neat thing for a Philadelphia Pub to have on a menu.  \n\nFor our main entrees, we both had the chicken pot pie.  The vegetables were plentiful, and the chicken was all white meat, though there was not that much of it.  The crust was somewhat flaky, but there was a section of my pot pie crust that didn't seem like it was cooked all the way through.  \n\nDessert portion sizes were huge!  We had the bread pudding which was average in taste, and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was served ala mode with vanilla ice cream as well.  The brownie was definitely dry and lacking in taste, though I consider myself to be a brownie snob, so maybe I'm being overly picky.","date":1255475104000}

There are pre-designed concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors.

We spoke about what I was looking for and I texted her some pictures of inspiration and my dress. She asked me if there were certain flowers I was looking for and my budget. I didn't have any flowers in mind, as long as the colors are what I wanted and told her my budget. She sent me a quote, staying within my budget, noting the flowers she would use for the bouquet, boutonniere, and floral arrangements for the arch I had. It was nice that Jen works with you to stay in your budget yet still get what you want.\n\nOn the wedding day, Jen arrived at my hotel door right on time with my beautiful bouquet. The floral arrangements at the site was gorgeous also. Jen really hit the mark on what I wanted for my wedding. She also was very sweet and added some roses on the chairs by the aisle to my surprise, which was not on the quote. That was very special because it pulled the whole ceremony look together and I felt Jen really wanted everything to look perfect for me.","date":1491607801000}

Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.\nBut whats this? \nThere are whispers that he no longer cooks for \"Best Taste of Asia,\" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.\n\nNo.\nNo, it can't be! \nI need to score - one .. final .. hit..\n\nLife ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?\nWhy am I here?\nWhat is Cheeze Wiz?\nIts done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.\n\nZaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entr\u00e9es like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. \n\nZaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.\n \nI've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.\n\nThe menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.\nThough some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. \nThe head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.\n\nI have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.\n\nThe bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \"Best taste of Asia,\" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. \n\nOnly good things can come of this, only good things.\n\nP.S.\nZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. \nHowever, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good.","date":1282331764000}

We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. \n\nWe ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. \n\nAfter our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. \n\nI ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. \n\nAnyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive, had a great attitude, and was knowledgeable!","date":1523798492000}

This would have been fine because a lot of times the \"run down\" places have the best \"authentic food,\" but this was not the case at Dinardo's.  At Dinardo's you do not get what you pay for as the prices are rather high and the food quality is rather low.

Nancy told us this dish far surpassed Bone Fish's Bang Bang Shrimp, to our surprise, it clearly did.  Our beverage and app shortly followed. \n\nShortly there after another server stopped by, Kyle, who was our designated server.  Boy, smile, great greeting, great attitude, engaging.  We talked a bit, figured our way through the menu and placed our order.\n\nFor our dishes, my wife selected the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese side -- Sharp Cheddar, Pepperjack, Mozzarella & Reggiano dusted with bread crumbs with cornbread as she had large lunch.  Very good.  Unexpected, light, not overly creamy, not burnt, just right.  And the corn bread with maple butter..... ahhhhhh that was really nice.\n\n I ordered the fish tacos-- 3 Flour tortillas, seasoned tilapia, chimichurri sauce, mango cilantro salsa & a lime cream drizzle.  Passed on starch sides and had their asparagus that was cooked to perfection.  To my surprise the they were filling, nice size portion (see photo)  not a two bite app.  Very moist and super fresh fish.\n\nGreat first experience all around expect one key aspect.  Their so called craft beer menu was really limited and did not contain a variety of types; focused more on IPAs.  Limited thinking for the bar manager I must say.  Kyle our waiter also bar-tends.  We got to talking and he offered with no questions to swap out my beer for another option --- Stoudts Scarlet, which is a reddish beer.  For my beer palette it was better then the others limited options had a nice taste at the swallow then waned off.   Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.

With probably less than a weeks notice, Leigh Anne stepped up and made the exact cake I had in my head.  I asked for a simple two tier lemon cake with no decorations.  Not only did she make this happen beautifully, she made chocolate vegan cupcakes for my daughter at the last minute.    I'm attaching a picture of the cake \"table\".  My daughter did the decorating and I must say, for someone with not much in the decorating department, everything came out better than I could ever imagine.

So I let the owner Angela do my nails. The first time was ok. Then the second time she did them the gel polish (which she talked me into getting instead of regular polish) started to chip within a day.

We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a \"to go\" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5\/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue. After 2 hours of waiting, and dealing with a fussy\/hungry toddler as a single mother I feel like the least they could have done is offer a free drink, to say \"we understand we couldn't accommodate you, but we tried.\" It's principal above all else. ...I just waisted 2 hours! And had to leave and take my baby somewhere else. Time is money! And I waisted 2 hours here! \nTime that is rare and I had to plan being a busy mother.\nI should have listened to the other reviews about the shitty service here. \nDon't waste your time or money!!!\nStay away!

I felt comfortable with their prices, competitive to anywhere else I've gone in Nashville worth mentioning. \n\nI didn't know where to park so I parked on the side in a random parking lot.

I liked the food, but you always have to have the first visit to see \"how they do things\" and figure out what your preferences will need to be.\n\nI did use their living social deal so I brought my dad in when he came in from out of town to try it out with me. I like the set up, the quaint house is cute (and well, quaint), but I can see how it wouldn't be ideal it if was jam packed. I imagine you could potentially do family style for some of the pub height tabletops. I did call ahead to make sure that I didn't need to print out the coupon and it could be used from my ipod and to make sure they were open, as the website said to just double check.\n\nWe started with shrimp spring rolls, probably the best I've had, the ingredients seemed fresher, and crispier. No shredded lettuce here. Simple and loosely wrapped, but you could taste the individual components. The peanut sauce was tasty too, though they don't have sirracha (spelling?) to add to it, just dried pepper flakes. \n\nWe then got the tom yum (gai?) with shrimp. I know it is hot (because of the name, duh), I usually prefer it a little less spicy (I am white), though I still got a good sour flavor (for instance at Thai chili it's too hot for me, I don't taste any sour). I usually get my tom yum without meat or seafood because I feel the meat gets dried out, but the server assured me the shrimp wouldn't be overcooked, and they weren't. I think they are making sure to use fresh ingredients, but I do prefer straw mushrooms (I think they are usually canned) over the button mushrooms they used. Next time I am probably going to try out a veggie version (i love the soup with the cabbage, and broccoli). The owner did tell me they are trying to be authentic and so maybe button mushrooms and less veggies is more authentic?\n\nWe then got shrimp pad thai and chicken pad keo mao (drunken noodle) minus the red pepper. Both were tasty, the portions were probably a little less than other places in Reno (not sure if just lunch sized portion now that I think about it).\n\nLike Ernie said, the pad thai noodles were a little soft, overdone, and its not the 'orange-y' sauce like other pad thai's, but there was still flavor there. The shrimp were also tasty in this dish. The drunken noodles was done exactly how I like them, lots of baby corns and the noodles covered in the sauce and of course spicy. \n\nMy dad and I talked outside for a while and the husband did come out and talk with me about the food, and asked if I was happy (we were outside a while). I hope the living social deals bring in some business, and I do plan on coming back, it is just hard because I don't live in the area. I also asked about the cooking classes (they are a steal at $65), and on facebook it said they are looking to improve and give some focus to that side of the business. The owner did say that they use just a regular kitchen so no woks or anything like that (meaning what they teach us can actually be done at home), I wonder if that is why the pad thai noodles are that way?

Thanks you two....idiots.....qausi-political rant over.\n\nThis store is harshly bright, rather dingy, and the selections, especially in the electronic section, are on the cheaper end.  On top of that, I've found the mainstream DVD and Blu-Ray movies are overpriced.  I laughed at the men's area, especially the young man's department, as they had a tv with music videos playing. I laughed because it just seemed a lame attempt to be cool and creating a shopping experience that you will find at a department store like Macy's or Dillard's. This is hard to create when everything is whitewashed. You will feel like you are in that August Burns Red's \"Whitewashed.\"  The best WTF moment is discovering the opportunity to purchase Joe Boxer male thongs. Who knew that Kmart cared about male panty line?\n\nOne great tip is you can find patio furniture cheap during the off season and clearance days. I bought a great patio table for under $50. So, keep that in mind.\n\nThe extra star is for the pharmacy, as they filled my prescription out efficiently and with the greatest of ease. The hours are little later than Target.  No problems there and credit when credit is due!\n\nThe later 80s quote, \"K-Mart sucks\", remains as true as ever and who knows, you may even bump into someone who still dresses from that Tom Cruise era who cares about male panty line.

The places has a open feeling, and never feels clausterphobic. The only time i've felt that I had bad seats was when we sat right under neath the scoreboard, and I had to keep on looking up.  I like how you can wander about and watch the game from the lower levels, and that despite it's a sold out game, it never feels cramped or you're really aching to get around the stadium.

I ordered a side of beans, chips and salsa, and guacamole. He ordered two steak tacos and a side of rice. The beans are hands down my favorite I've had from a mexican restaurant.  My only complaint is that, unfortunately you do not get a very big portion. The salsa is so fresh tasting and delicious-very cilantro forward, and the chips were nice, thick and crunchy without being oily at all. Take note though, chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately. Now let me get to the best part-the made to order, chunky guacamole. The hardy chips would definitely withstand this heavy duty guac, but I opted instead for tortillas as my vessel to stuff it with along with my beans and salsa. The hot sauces were anything but, though admittedly my tolerance to spices may be higher than the average persons. While I had a great eating experience, my boyfriend did not. He said the meat was of low quality and quite flavorless. He did say he would give it another shot though!","date":1433787038000}

I had a Groupon that was about to expire so I took my parents out to dinner.  I knew going in that Broussards is a very old skool New Orleans restaurant, and it is very nice when you walk in to see the old tile on the walls in the foyer of the building. The courtyard is beautiful and I just had to turn into a tourist and take a picture in front of the fountain with my mom. We were seated and very promptly greeted by the drink guy.  He brought us our water and told us about the extensive wine list, but they were of course out of the Pinot Grigio that I ordered.  He successfully suggested a Chardonnay for me instead and I was happy. The head waiter came out and explained with great detail the specials for the night, but I went for menu regulars, the maytag blue cheese salad and the pecan crusted drum. I wanted more salad, it was so good, I ate it up so fast. The drum was excellent too. It had this soy butter sauce on it that was so good and topped with crawfish. I was definitely happy with my meal and glad I had the experience. What makes me knock off two stars is that though the foyer's vintage appeal is nice and the courtyard is beautiful, I feel like the dining room needs an upgrade.  The chandeliers on the walls in the main dining room are very reminiscent of the hallways of my grandmother's assisted living home. I think its just one of those places I am glad to say I've been to, but I don't think I will choose to go there again.","date":1344988050000}

I visited on 3\/8\/13 and got their \"Mini Manicure\"- it's only $15!  I chose an OPI polish and the nail technician did a GREAT job!  So great in fact, that today on Monday, 3\/18\/13- I did not have ONE CHIP!  This is amazing for polish!  My nails looked fabulous!  The technician was friendly, as were the other stylists.  I'm not sure if it was the manager or the owner that was working the front desk- but she came over as well and was super friendly and welcoming.  The salon looks amazing, trendy, and peaceful.  It has a great vibe.\n\nI was so happy with my first appointment- that I went back today, and left disappointed.  I went to the same nail techinician- and we talked as she worked on my nails.  The person working the front desk (seemed like an owner\/ manager- although different from my first visit) was SO  nice, welcoming, and talkative.  This time though I needed a gel manicure, in french- as I am in a wedding this weekend.  I explained that I was in the wedding, assuming the technician would know that this more special than just an everyday manicure  The technician stated after she started my nails, that she did not have the proper brush that she needed in order to do the manicure.  So like most places- they paint the white, and then go back later with a brush to create the crisp, perfect line.  Since she did not have the brush to do that- she used a q- tip.  So obviously the lines are not perfect or even.  Along with the lines being uneven- some are thicker than others, and the edges go up, instead of down.  My nails are not at all filed and shaped pretty either.  For $40 (+ a tip)- I really expect them to look right.  I went during my lunch hour, and it was supposed to be 30 minute appointment, but the appointment took a little bit over an hour.  I understand that french takes a little extra time- but this seemed like quite a bit extra.  I was late for work, and had to hurry out of there when she was finished and did not want to be even more late to work to stay there to make a complaint.  I wish I would have- but I also felt bad because the technician was trying so hard- but they are just not up to par.\n\nI'm conflicted, but I don't know that I'll return.  I loved it to so much the first time, I even sent friends over there.  But after this time- I am not happy with the product.  I wish it wasn't gel- because I can't even take the polish off myself.  So I'm forced to have nails that I am unhappy with, or go to somewhere else and pay to have this taken off, and then pay to have them re done- all before a 6am flight on Wednesday morning, and it's Monday afternoon....","date":1363638747000}

With the established Legends Sports Bar directly across the street I thought this place must have something very special to feel they can compete.\n\nThey took over the building that was prevriously used by the Ruby River Steakhouse.  The owners apparently opted not to change a thing about the indoor seating.  Gone are all the cowboy boots, up are various team jerseys. It looks like somebody went to Pro Image at the mall to decorate the place.  Nothing appears to be autographed or evoke a sense of authenticity.\n\nVideo games are available for the kids, so bring your quarters.  No dart boards, shuffleboard, air hockey or pool tables.  This is pretty much a dine and drink only establishment.\n\nMore TV's in the place than I could count (I figure at least 20), all tuned to ESPN or ESPN2.  No clue at this time if they are choosing to use Direct TV, Dish, or Cable One for their service.  However, they already have made one of the biggest mistakes I think most wannabe sports bars make; they broadcast music rather than sound from a live sporting event.  With live sporting events available almost everyday from 12pm - 12am, you would think they would want to try to emphasize that rather than muzak (tuned to a country station; still feels like the Ruby River).\n\nA word of advice here, if you want people to stay and eat and drink, you gotta give them something on which to focus their attention.  The sounds of the game will get their attention.  They came to a sports bar to think about sports, not Conway Twitty.\n\nTypically, when I see the word pub in a restaurant name, I think it is just beer and wine, but it looks like Timeout has a full bar with several specialty drinks.  With a designated driver, it may be fun to experiment.\n\nThe food is typical sports bar fare; salads, burgers, pasta.  Most items will cost $9 - $11, with entrees running more.  A few twists on their offerings will ensure that I stop in to try something different, but unless the atmosphere improves, I think I will always leave a little disappointed. \n\nThose staying at the nearby motel may like the proximity, but I think they might find the walk across the street to Legends worth the extra steps.\n\nHappy Hour 2pm - 6pm Monday -  Friday; Late Happy Hour 10pm - close Monday - Thursday.  Happy Hour all day Sunday.","date":1309312016000}

If there were people in the spa, they could be heard, but the noise didn't bother since the spa closed at 9pm.  The room was clean with a nice couch to lounge on, a refrigerator, a nice fireplace, ample closet and counter space, and a nice bathroom.  The wine and cheese at 5 was a nice touch as well.  Although this place didn't have a lot of extras, it was a pleasant stay, friendly and helpful staff, a good price, perfect location, and suited our needs just fine for a place in Santa Barbara.  My only complaint was that the room got a little stuffy, but was fine once we opened the windows and used the ceiling fan to air it out.  Would consider staying here again.","date":1303496726000}

I got a message from the owner saying he'd like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So, I thought since he's the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I'm really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a \"white blonde\". He said you won't have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn't really free! So, I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you'll have to pay for the hair color and \"medicine\" but he won't charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn't give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me, I don't want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he's gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he's definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she's styling my hair and she said she doesn't do hair and I wouldn't want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn't happy, she told the lady she didn't like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn't happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That's not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don't like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it's not orange it's the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn't the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn't what I wanted and it wasn't gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn't get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn't mess up, he's been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn't be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don't care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I'm always 100% honest.

I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with Breanna, the venue manager and Eli, the food and beverage director. Our wedding here was a destination wedding, so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. Being a couple straight out of grad school, we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. Everything worked out on all accounts! \n\nWe first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is GORGEOUS. The pricing was very straightforward, which we really appreciated, and when looking at other options in the Santa Barbara area, the Riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer, rent linens, etc etc). Planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country, it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.\n\nThe looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. With people coming from the east coast and middle of the country, we wanted something that would really showcase Santa Barbara's cool architecture and vibe. The mansion is exactly that.  The layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. We were able to enjoy the California weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, then go inside for dinner, avoiding the cooler night air. Later, we could turn up the party in the bar\/dance floor area, while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. It really has something for everyone.\n\nWhat I didn't realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. Breanna was super helpful, answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly, and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. When we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding, Breanna and Eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of, as they did the day of the wedding too. Eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! My dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts, as well as got some cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes- also a great idea!). Eli worked with him to get whatever he needed, risers, tablecloths, etc and was really sweet about it. \n\nThe attention to bartending at the Riviera Mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. Breanna worked with me and the bartender (who's name I forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. She even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! At the wedding, everyone raved about them, even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. The staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour, and also passed trays of drinks, so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). Hell, Eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! Really spectacular and attentive service.\n\nFive stars all around. It was absolutely a joy to have our wedding here.","date":1450648022000}

But I think we have a winner here.\n\nWhen this Wawa store opened for business, gas prices at gas stations all along Concord Pike fell by 30 cents per gallon just to compete with them. Sure, this Wawa store could've followed the general pricing in the area and lowered prices just a few cents, keeping the bulk of the profit. But no, they'll have none of that. I love a store that is on the side of my wallet!\n\nSecondly, I love the automatic start\/stop digital air pump. So far, I've only seen that at BJ's Wholesale and Sheetz. It's a snap to use and I get the exact tire pressure every time.\n\nAs for service, they seem nice and relatively efficient. The internal layout of the store is the new style that I first saw in Newark. Having separate non-cigarette cashier lines may speed things up in peak periods, although I've never been there during the day, so I wouldn't know.","date":1386379696000}

My first exposure to his succulent birds was the hot chicken at The Fat Ham. Lo and behold, his lavender honey fried chicken tops its spicy cousin. The chicken is brined in buttermilk, dredged in seasoned flour and sits for ten minutes. It's then coated with a second round of flour and dropped into the fryer. The chicken (breast, wing, thigh, drumstick) is drizzled with lavender honey and sprinkled with salt and ground pink peppercorns. It comes with a buttermilk biscuit, whipped honey-thyme butter, and red bliss potato salad. It is some of the best fried chicken I've eaten in a long time. Crunchy, crispy coating on the outside with a juicy, moist inside. The sweet honey glaze is truly outstanding and finger lickin' good. The biscuit is awesome. I would definitely order this dish again and again. I got the salty but delicious fried smelts with chili pepper aioli as an appetizer. My friend Chris W got the filet mignon and butter poached king crab surf and turf. For dessert, I had a slice of salted pecan pie and he had the ice cream sundae. Every dish at Juniper Commons was top-notch. Chef Sbraga does it again!","date":1430250217000}

Maybe he was having a bad day, but I still would have expected better. \n\nWe had mixed experiences with the food. Mine and our friends' was OK, but my wife's baked ravioli would have been more use to a hockey team for use as pucks. They were really overdone - woefully overdone. \n\nThe worst part was that our table was next to the opera singer guy. He was singing extremely loudly and it was nigh impossible to maintain a conversation - especially coupled with how close we were to the table next to us and their attempts to speak over Opera Guy.\n\nPart of me wants to give them another chance (since I hate writing bad reviews) and the other part is annoyed over the waiter's attitude. I probably will not go back.

He then continued to yell at us from across the restaurant after we sat down  (instead of coming up to our table and actually having a conversation) and says, \"please let me know how your food is because that's the only way I can know if we are doing a good job or not is when customers tell me.\"  But we agreed that the vibe he gave off would not be that of open mindedness and gratitude if we were to say anything about his plate of olive oil, er I mean hummus.

We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.\n\nAs starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and \"love sauce.\"  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.\n\nThe staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.\n\nBy the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.  I guess that calls for a return visit, don't you?","date":1314235354000}

Stepping into the dark, cool interior of Sapore made for a refreshing change after the sweltering July heatwave. It was no problem for our party of three to be seated; the fact that we had a reservation helped, I am sure. We started out with drinks--bellinis for my two dinner companions and a classic vodka martini for me. I appreciated being able to customize my drink with a blue-cheese-stuffed olive and an anchovy. I would never have thought to put an anchovy in a martini, but it looks like this will be a new obsession for me. \n\nOn to the food. We opted to skip the appetizers and go straight to soup\/salad and entrees (all the better to save room for dessert). My mom went with the Italian soup and my other dining companion and I split the Caprese salad, a solid presentation that did not blow me away, but certainly does not provide grist for anything like the negative reviews of this establishment that I have seen on yelp. I didn't know what to expect in terms of pasta portions here, so I went with the Chicken Marsala. It might have been nice to have pasta to pick up some of the sauce, but I appreciated that the dish was hot by temperature and I even had enough for leftovers (to which I added pasta, in the comfort and convenience of my home).\n\nThe dessert selection was excellent.

So, on a beautifully humid August morning I walked over to check it. \n\n1) The atmosphere is pretty standard. Open space with the coffee bar in the back left corner and ordinary tables and chairs scattered throughout. No college coffee shop couches or armchairs but no industrial airbnb chic vibe either. Lacked uniqueness. \n\n2) The name Henry reminds me of Thomas the tank engine. Was there a train named Henry on there or not? If so, was he chill or not. Could add one star for chill train association. \n\n3) The coffee was not good. I got an iced coffee (STFU) and it was super bitter.

Upon arriving, you are immediately welcomed with the scent of fresh baked cookies. Walking up to the desk we were greeted by Valorie who informed us that cookies and water were complementary to guests and that we were more than welcome. Across from the desk we noticed a book shelf. This is not the kind of book shelf where rejected leftovers were placed but rather, a wide range of books by well known authors. The name of the program was called Read it and Return. In essence, you can borrow a book for the duration of your stay and if you don't finish it you can return it the next time you stay at the hotel at any of the Carlson hotels who have the same program! ( what!?! Cookies and books!?! YES!) Right off the bat, we felt like we were right at home.\n\n   Arriving at our room, we noticed that everything was extremely clean and there was a refrigerator (with a small freezer) , a microwave, a coffee maker, and a well working A.C. (you know, the kind that you don't have to yell over to have a conversation). The bathroom was stocked with brand name shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.\n\n  Our next stop was the smoking area. Normally, smokers feel as though they have been marooned to a small place behind the dumpster...but not here! Provided was 2 sets of swinging benches; set far enough away so that it did not disturb the guests in rooms around the area but no a 10 mile hike for those adults who enjoy the pleasure. Did I also mention they have smoking rooms available?\n\nIn the morning, feel free to partake in a complimentary breakfast (NOT CONTINENTAL)-I mean a real breakfast which changes daily; anything from fresh made waffles to eggs, sausage, and bacon! Also, cold cereal, juices, and coffees have options! Coffee is available 24\/7 as well! \n\nThe hotel also has a pool and hot tub which I personally observed them clean daily!\n\nOn our last night we got back late and I was going to ask the desk for a late check out, but there was no need! Their check out time is 12:00 Pm as opposed to the hotel usual of 11:00 Am. That worked out well for us.\n\nAt checkout we were asked if there was anything we would change about the hotel or our stay. I made small suggestions which I thought would help them, but definitely nothing major. The desk person wrote down what I said and said she would pass it on! I was impressed with that, because we've been asked about our stay at other places, but it seemed more out of routine than actual interest. Here, she seemed genuinely interested. We don't usually do reviews, so I'm sorry for the long review. However, we wanted you to get a real feel for this wonderful hotel and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did! Thanks for reading and safe travels. J & Niki.","date":1408922392000}

We never got a confirmation email when booking over the phone. Then during the tour we had to wait and be hassled over payment that was already cleared on our account. Don't do this tour if you get carsick easily. It was full and we had to sit in the back. You can't see anything on the tour through the tinted windows and you only stop at two places that I never would have stopped at on my own. \n\nThe only intriguing part was the Katrina history during the visit the the 9th ward. Do yourself a favor and take the green street cars, save your money and REALLY see things on your own time. We couldn't get pictures of anything and wish we would have done a walking tour instead or tried the red bus tours.\n\nPLANTATION TOUR: 5 STARS! Our driver Stacie gave us a history of the surrounding area and a lot of cool information on our way to the plantation. Laura Creole plantation had an amazing history. Our guide there was Ethan and he did a really good job explaining about the owners journey to this land and how the slaves were treated and also their journey. We felt that it was a balanced historical view of the plantation in general. After that tour we went to the Oak Alley plantation. The grounds alone are worth the trip. The tour guides really focus on the landowners and not so much on the lives of the slaves living there. But you have some time after the tour to visit the  slave quarters on your own. But we wished that there would have been a more balanced explanation of both experiences like at the Laura Plantation. The buses are big and you can recline and take a nap on your way back to the hotel. (No car sickness) \n\nSWAMP TOUR: 4 STARS and we didn't even see any alligators! This would have been a five-star tour if we would have seen alligators. But our guide Henry was very thorough and explained a lot of great details about the surrounding area. We got to see some boars, raccoons, and birds. It started to rain with thunder and lightning so we did not see any alligators because we had to go back for safety reasons. We did try to see some alligators but they don't come out if it's cold. Don't book your tour if it's cold or storming and I'm sure it will be a 5 star tour for you.

I'd say it was almost 10 minutes before they finally came and took out order. I started to wonder who our waitress was because 2 different females took the drink order and delivered them. Finally, one of the females came and took our order, so we must have been there for 15 minutes at least before our food order was taken. 10 minutes had gone by and a lady got sat in the booth next to us. Another 10 minutes later, she got her food before we did. So she got there after us, ordered after us, but received hers before us.

And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. \n\nAs my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.\n\nWhen our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.\n\nWarning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. \n\nAll in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable.

I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.  \n\nI certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple, not bad but also nothing great.\n\nMy biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?\n\nI anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves, but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.\n\nThe order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours, we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before, both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization, the slow speed at which we were served, or the cleanliness of the restaurant.\n\nAfter 3 attempts, I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co, get the same level of food, but in a clean environment and a timely setting.","date":1268519590000}

I am really glad I chose them.\n\nFirst off their place is really clean and professional, you feel more like you are in a bank or a business office than a body shop.  I don't mind the typical \"shop\" feel of most of these places, but the experience at Prestigious is a notch above that and I appreciated it.\n\nNext off, they assigned a specific advisor, Juan Mendez to work with me from start to finish through my repair.  He was really knowledgeable and provided detailed information to me about how they were going to diagnose everything and ensure that all of the various components of the damage were fixed correctly.  There was an added challenge in my case because I was hit in nearly the same place by two different drivers:  one submitted a claim through insurance and the other asked to pay outside of insurance.  I explained all of this to Juan and he came up with a forensically defensible way to determine the value of the damage caused by each of the accidents so that the costs could be assessed fairly and accurately.\n\nJuan set up my rental for me and kept me updated regularly throughout the repair process, which in my case took a while due to the insurance company requiring additional evaluations etc. and the Thanksgiving holiday.  Detailed updates, and the fact that these came to me without me having to ask for them, made it a lot less stressful during the time my car was in the shop.  Juan (and I believe all the other staff who hold similar positions over there) also clearly understands all of the procedures, and deviations that can occur from these procedures, that are related to processing insurance claims and he was always able to answer any questions I had.\n\nI got the vehicle back yesterday and the quality of the work is 1st class.  There is no way to tell that anything ever happened to the back of my car...it looks exactly as it did when I purchased it in late July.  I was particularly concerned about paint matching because all of the exterior damage was to the bumper (a plastic part) which had to be matched to the car body panels (metal parts).  Anyone who knows anything about paint and body work knows that it is a challenge to match paints on different substrates, and most body shops, even Prestigious, have disclaimers about this that are plainly visible in their offices.  I told them up front I was really concerned about this, and they said not to worry.  They were right....they did a dead-perfect color match in my case.  I have mild OCD and I notice even the smallest differences and defects in things, and I was 100% satisfied with the paint match, as well as the gap tolerances etc. on my repair.  If a place can meet my standards, it is going to far surpass most people's standards.\n\nIt sucked to get hit twice in two weeks, in a brand new car....but I am thrilled that I found this place as part of the deal.  I would take my vehicles here from now on and recommend them to anyone who wants a top quality job with serious attention paid to fit and finish.","date":1386373900000}

The counter faces the cooks' area, which I like because the bustle of multiple grills, fryers, and prep areas serves as a good distraction, not to mention you get frequent interaction with the staff.  They were busy and getting everything done, but they weren't rude or frazzled, and I had a real sweet waitress.\n\nI ordered the fried shrimp po boy dressed, and asked for a side of rebbeans instead of fries.  I almost had second thoughts on that because the burgers that they were cooking right in front of me looked and smelled so good.

My husband and I walked in without reservations during their Sunday Jazz Brunch. We waited about 40 minutes, but we had the music and ambience to keep us occupied. \n\nDespite the place being ridiculously busy, our server didn't rush us at all. He encouraged us to take our time browsing the menu and placing our orders- definitely one of the friendliest servers I've encountered. \n\nThe food here was absolutely amazing! The complimentary bread and butter was very nice. My husband and I started off with the seafood gumbo, and it was delicious! Both of us had a sea bass entree and it was definitely the best fish I've ever had. The fish came with a side of green beans and this DELICIOUS sauce that could make anything taste great. We finished off with chocolate orange ice cream and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert. The next table over was raving about their bread pudding, so I'm guessing dessert is usually a hit all around at this place. \n\nThe coolest bit about my experience here was that my husband and I got seated where Ronald Reagan sat on his two visits to Mr. B's (far left corner)- Reagan just so happened to visit on my birthday! \n\nOur bill came out to be $100+ but it was worth every penny.

Everywhere you turn there is another interesting piece of art work to look at. Our room was very nice, keurig coffee machine,large luxurious shower, comfy robes, and comfortable california king. We had tickets to the Pacers game which worked out perfectly. We had drinks and dinner before the game at Plat 99 which is in the hotel- again more great decor. They had a whole timeline of cocktails and complementary truffle popcorn. (they also had a really cool outdoor rooftop seating area for the bar, but was too cold and snowy to go out on) Bankers Field house was maybe 1 minute away walking. After the game we came back and got some drinks at Plat 99 again, it was pretty crowded, fun environment. For breakfast we ate at the Market Place downstairs, it was one set price for a buffet and had a lot of good food.\n\nWe checked out at 11am- very easy and the concierge was friendly and helpful. Before we left we spent about 30 minutes just walking around the hotel looking at all the art work, it is like a modern art museum. \n\nOverall we loved this hotel, for a quick getaway to Indianapolis, especially if you are going to a Pacers or Colts game, is was fantastic.

The tacos has scraps of beef with cilantro and onion.  They also have the regular styled tacos with tomatoes and lettuce.  The dog was the last one sitting the bin and a bit soggy.  Compared to truck dogs, it does not compare.  The tacos were simply bits of beef with onion and cilantro, nothing impressive and nothing like what is seen in the pictures.\n\nPerhaps, my disappointing experience was due to how the place was packed, had a line out the door by the time I left, and was somewhat loud, but that is no excuse for the terrible eating experience.

Should my star rating be based upon comparing Sam's to all Sports Bars in which I have ever been?  Or, should it be a comparison to Nashville Sports Bars?\n\nI chose the former:  compared to everywhere - because if you're from out of town that only seemed fair.  The sad news is that for a vibrant southeastern city where we have two professional sports teams, our sports bars kinda suck.\n\nSam's is honestly one of two great sports bars in the city.  I really like Sam's and I really like the patio in Spring, Summer, and early Autumn.  But, when compared to so many sports bars across the country in other cities of comparable size with their own sports' teams... Sam's is just mediocre.  \n\nThe service is always a toss up, and the ladies dressed in those referee outfits - could you not find some attractive Southern women to put on those booty shorts and v-cut referee shirts?  Some of the regular old-time employees who have been there since I was in undergrad - a decade ago - really should not be wearing tight clothes.  Wow.  That was just really mean.  I'm sorry.\n\nThe food is on the better side of bar fare.  But their beer selection could want for some better beers and a wider variety of selection.  The mixed drinks tend to be a bit weak, in my opinion.\n\nBut, hey, it's a bar.  It has lots of TVs and they play the game commentary over the speakers throughout the bar.

We had a hell of a time getting here since it was on the other side of the parade from where we were staying.\n   Nonetheless, we had a great meal. \n    Service was spot on. Professional but not overbearing or obvious. \n    A little disappointed that they were out of two ingredients for one of their signature cocktails, but it WAS the day before Mardi Gras.\n   The bread and butter at the table was excellent. Crunchy outside, soft inside.\n   The beets salad was so much better and different from similarly named items at other restaurants. The greens literally tasted like they had been picked from a sun warmed field minutes before.\n    G's Choucroute was a meaty fiesta. He loved it. My crab ravioli was lovely with a delicate Meyer lemon sauce. \n    Bread pudding for dessert was just how we like it - sans raisins.\n    Truly a memorable meal.

The one place you never cut corners is in the food, and that's exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn't get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip, at all. The third salsa, the pics de gallo, was the worst chop job I've ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out. \n\nWithout even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible. \n\nI used to love the rice, it changed. I used to love the chicken quesadilla, now it's flavorless and covered in 2 lbs of cheese for 1\/2 a breast.\n\nPlease go back to your old ways and cut costs elsewhere, other than the food.","date":1457318574000}

I have a bad back (bulging and hemorrhaged discs) and sometimes I can't sit in the same place for long periods of time. Eddie was very helpful and accommodating with that. While I was there I talked to pretty much every employee there. The entire staff are really friendly. It's a cool place to be. I did a Yelp check-in and got $10 off! How cool is that?! On the website I saw that the owner, Chino developed his own tattoo ointment. He said that he just wasn't very happy with the other stuff that's out there because they are petroleum product so he did a ton of research and developed his own. It has ingredients like sunflower and soybean oil, lavender, beeswax, vitamin E, Shea and cocoa butter. I bought some and it is indeed very soothing. If you are looking to get inked, go here.

I can only speak for the manicure\/pedicure aspect because I did not get a massage. Typically, you go to a spa to escape and relax - you can not do that here. It is small, dirty, and the staff is terrible. \n\nI walked in and the receptionist was on the phone - he did acknowledge that I was standing there, but several staff walked by and did not offer to assist. Finally, after two other guests came in behind me, someone came up and took me back - just to get me out of the way. Asked what my name was and left. Did not offer me water\/refreshments of any kind. I've had better reception at the local nail salon. Then I had to wait for 10-15 minutes for my technician to finish up her current client, which I didn't mind because I leisurely picked out my color. When it was my turn, the nail technician was shaky and rushed. She cut my cuticle and I bled. She was sick and kept blowing her nose into her shirt (gross!!) and took time outs to really blow\/dig in her nose with a tissue right in front of me! Lady, you are touching my hands with yours, you are blowing bacteria into the air, if you are that sick don't come to work - *Management, if your employee is that sick do not make them come in! You will lose clients. \n\nShe gave me the worst hand\/arm massage I have ever had (that is usually everyone's favorite part, and the technician's opportunity to shine!). No pressure was applied, and she just basically rubbed lotion into my skin and made a snarky comment about how my skin was so dry is was just \"drinking up all the lotion.\" Yes, I realize it's dry, probably due to the 20 degree weather and wind outside, but thank you for making me feel self-conscious. \n\nWhen I went to leave the receptionist was on the phone again, but did actually put them on hold to get me out of there. I opted to put everything on my room charge, which resulted in extra fees but I didn't care. There was a blaring sign saying how they preferred cash gratuity and that there would be extra fees associated with putting services on your room. Yes, everyone prefers cash gratuity - but how tacky can you be?!! \n\nOverall, it was an extremely disappointing experience. I have been wanting to stay at the Monteleone for years and made it a priority to experience their salon. My gel nail polish is already chipping and it hasn't even been a week. Spa Aria definitely needs a overhaul and I would recommend you go anywhere else but here.","date":1484432215000}

The batter wasn't thick, and it has a crispiness to it that was a great contrast to the moistness and juiciness of the fish.  I have to admit, when I'm not sure what to get I think of getting a burger or fish & chips, and there weren't any burgers on the dinner menu.  The serving size was 3 cod pieces, approx 4-6 oz, along with a generous serving of fries. Additionally, the tartar sauce appeared to be made in house, had a great flavor.  So, if you're in the mood for fish and chips, I would highly recommend getting them here...because while the serving size isn't as big as Great Basin's, it tastes way better.\n\nMy wife had the salmon tacos, and for the side she had the chicken tortilla soup.  While the tacos had some great flavors the salmon was a bit overcooked, thus making the tacos a bit overshadowed by the soup.  Similar to the fish & chips above, the serving size wasn't large, only 2 tacos, but again, the flavors were very good.\n\nIf you're starving and want a large meal with leftovers I'd recommend other places, but if you want a satisfying meal that's an appropriate size this place is very good.","date":1464702357000}

I took my mum here for her birthday for lunch and we were both so pleased!! \n\nSad to say, but due to some health issues, I've had to really change my diet around. This was my first time going out to eat since being on this new regimen. I'm definitely limited, which is too bad, and there was a lot I couldn't have. The menu has good selections, but there is a lot with meat, and I've been a vegetarian for years. Regardless, they serve great food, I just like big menus. Everything is made in house and they use fresh and local ingredients. My mum got the Vermonter salad, which she LOVED!!! It had mixed greens, Vermont cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, pecans, and dried cherries. The dressing was a home made honey vinaigrette I believe. It came with two delicious pieces of muesli bread with a home made honey butter. YUM!! I had the tuna plate, which was great too. It had a very good portion of tuna salad, mixed greens, mixed veggies, and came with a biscuit with that delicious honey butter. It also came with a fresh fruit bowl!!!! I couldn't have the biscuit so I traded for muesli and man that stuff was delicious. My mum loves the biscuit too. Everything is definitely made with love and happiness here!!!\n\nThe patio is so cute, 4 tables on a nice little deck with fans and hanging lights. Our server was wonderful, SO kind and adorable.

Certainly not the best I've ever had but good enough. The to go packaging was a bit overkill just for that one slice of cake, as was the $10 price tag. That being said, I'm sure the \"fanciness\" of the place is what makes it so appealing to folks. It really is quite unique and cute for our area and would be a good place to go with the gals (rather than my husband who hates all things trendy, lol). \n\nMy problem, though, was with the service. We placed our order for the carrot cake with a nice young teenager, and then waited. And waited. I could see the carrot cake just sitting in the pretty covered cake stand, and I felt really tempted to just slice it myself. After a bit (felt like 10 minutes, although I'm sure it was more like 5 or 6), another employee came and sliced the carrot cake, setting the slice on the back counter with the ticket. And then we waited. And waited some more. After about another 5 to 10 minutes, I flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us. He seemed confused, and it took an awkward minute-long exchange for him to understand we hadn't yet received our order. He did apologize for the wait, which I do appreciate, boxed up the cake, and then we were on our way.\n\nI should clarify that we did not go into the shop at a busy time. It was a relatively cool day and not many people were out. While there were maybe 2 to 3 tables seated, we were the only ones at the counter ordering. And while I'm sure the wait staff who repeatedly walked by our lonely piece of carrot cake sitting on the back counter had many important tasks...I just wanted to eat my $10 cake.\n\nFour stars for the cake. Two stars for the service.","date":1465679393000}

I find the rates reasonable and have been a member since they opened and will continue to be a member. So, for the rating I give the gym at CF a 3.5 star, I give MBSC a 1.5 star for an overall 2.5 star rating.\n\nMBSC review: I thought I would kick it up a notch so joined the MBSC thrive program at CF on South Street and tried it for three months. Trainers really aren't \"personal\" trainers. They have a set program that they put people through and you have very little to say about what you like\/don't like. The trainers work with several people in a session so depending on how many people are in a session you could be waiting for the trainer to get back to you or waiting for the person in front of you to finish. One of the things that frustrated me is they want you to push through the routine they have come up for you in the hour's time. The sessions are hard with ropes, sleds, balls, bands, cables, weights and the most uncomfortable stationary bike I've ever had to sit on (and they make you end every session on the thing). No two sessions are alike - so if you like variety then great, if you like consistency or at least enough repetition to get the moves and form down then not so great. I seldom found a session to be fun or enjoyable, rather I often felt like I was a contestant on the Biggest Loser. They also play hip-hop all day long and you either like it or you don't. The environment and training is designed (in my opinion) to appeal to 20-30yo demographic.\n\nIf you really want to push yourself beyond your limits and don't care how you get there then you might really enjoy the MBSC program. If you want a professional personal trainer to spend quality time with you in achieving your goals and if you want a training program that you actually learn what muscle groups you are working and not just to be pushed through a routine then you probably won't like MBSC. Definitely do a introductory program because the usual 30 day notice from the contract date applies if you cancel and it's $200+\/mo program.","date":1389980319000}

My first visit was a kinda a let down.  I had heard that bier was the place to go for great beers in Indianapolis, but I only found 2 that I liked and only 1 was memorable.  However, bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps, I like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer.   The tap room is a lot of fun too with people constantly revolving around the taps to taste and find their favorite for the week and then relaxing and talking in the lounge area.  I only gave them 3stars this time but I look forward to improving their score after future visits.","date":1354588749000}

Cupcake was good, mocha filling best part. Rasberry truffle was my fav, love the dark chocolate so it's not cloyingly sweet. The coffee was a wonderful chaser, not overly burnt, smoky, or acidic... I usually have coffee with milk n sugar, forgot this time, but I didn't even need it!  Seating was nice, with a few cafe tables inside. Enough for our 6-girl troop.

The rooms are spacious, modern and gorgeous. \nThe decor is chic and attractive: big wooden desk, hardwood floors, couches and throw pillows: Looks more like a friend's apartment than a hotel. \n\nFree breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. It's not a hot breakfast (I've had so many mass-produced bad ones, so I'm not complaining) but greek yogurt, a huge croissant, an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! They leave it at your door though, instead of ringing your bell to wake you. So if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m., check outside your door; by 7:01 it WILL be there. \n\nCoffee, a variety of teas, cold and hot water, as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24\/7 in the lobby. There are doorbells for each room, and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. Floors are acessible with a keycard as well, for extra protection. The staff is very polite: one of the few places in Philly where someone will actually say \"good morning\" to you (No, seriously. I lived there for 5 years, so trust me on that). They're also extremely helpful. When I checked in the night before, the gentleman at the reservation desk called to make sure I had a cab waiting for me at 8:15 the next morning so that I could make my speaking engagement on time. While I was getting my clothes ready, my iron was making more wrinkles than it was taking out, so I asked them for a new one and within 30 seconds, I had a brand new model with all the bells and whistles.\n\nI've read a few reviews talking about the noise level of this place. My room was closest to the reception desk and I never heard a peep. There were people out and about, but I didn't hear a thing. And I'm a very light sleeper...\n\nA few things to note:\nIts location on a tight, one way street can cause a little difficulty if you're traveling solo, but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks, you should be fine. The parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel, but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there. \n\nThere's a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub\/shower combo. It fits one comfortably enough... provided that you're not too far from average height and build. (My boyfriend is 6'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)\n\nDon't expect much of a view. The view from our room was of the side of another building. But that's what the city is for... go out there and see something!\n\nOverall, this was an excellent trip and a great find. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.","date":1456263099000}

A cute little bakery and the employees are super attentive. I walked in and was bouncing around from one dessert to another deciding if I should make a purchase. The employee offered me a sample of the banana puddings - definitely try some! And you know how sometimes when they give you so small of a sample to taste, you can't really make a proper judgment because there isn't enough to judge from? Not the case here!\n\nI got the salted caramel banana, the strawberry banana pudding and the upside pineapple cake.\n\nThoughts: OMG!! I never crave banana pudding and never really thought anything of the dessert. But man after this, I wanted to go home and make my own banana pudding (Although I highly doubt that I could make it half as good)! Their desserts are crafted perfect - three\/four layers depending on what you get. The bottom layer the the pudding, second layer is the nilla wafers or they might even use some sort of pound cake(whatever it was - it was AMAZING), third layer, the strawberry and then the top layer is pudding with a nice whipped creme and topping. The creme has so much flavor and the texture is so smooth. Everything just comes together so nicely! \n\nThe upside pineapple cake was BOMB. the cake wasn't too fluffy but was dense to the perfect amount to Taste like what it's suppose to. The pineapple flavor isn't overwhelming but just right. My only problem was that the pineapple bottom got a little too carameliZed with brown sugar and was a bit hard to chew.\n\nDefinitely go to this place!

You are close to my house, have ample parking, and large spacious tables.  you even have a fireplace in the back for a little ambiance. \n\nfriends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick\/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive. \n\nhubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings, and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people, seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more, the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses. \n\nour server was great, attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check, would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants, where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention, all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic, and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows, it may have even made up for the bland flavors. \n\nperhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.  Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings, but takeout only. no more dining in at this place.","date":1378264474000}

We were warned of possible waiting times so came here on a Saturday around 10:45, and a line was already forming! \n\nFor apps, we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus. The takoyaki are delicious-an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. Takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle, topped with sauces and squid flakes (?). I definitely recommend this app. As for the fried octopus, it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side, but it didn't come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in.\n\nFor ramen, I got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my SO got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen. For both ramen, the thin noodles were mushy\/overcooked and just didn't quite fit with the ramen. That was the flaw with the dishes, and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour-y water so it wasn't as clean (which explains the mushy feeling). They should use more bouncy noodles for this.\n\nNow let's talk about the broth. The broth is flavorful, but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth. I prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason.\n\nOverall, delicious food and pricing is reasonable. The decor is very nice as well, but screaming kids that were running around didn't make our meal pleasant.","date":1519499430000}

Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.

It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it \"Southern\".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.

Where do I start with this place? First time experience, went in with my partner.\n\nWalking in at about 7:30 on a Friday night (st paddys day weekend even)  and the  place had about 4 customers. That should have been my first clue as to what our experience was going to be like.\n\nWe seated ourselves and the waitress, an older gal maybe mid to late 40's who had greasy stringy unwashed hair and rotting teeth came up and took our drink order. My girlfriend got a Dr. Pepper and I got a water. She brought out Coke instead of DP. No biggie. We let it go, assuming it was an honest mistake. After about 10 minutes she returns and we order a 12 piece \"jumbo\" wing basket ($11.99), a 6 piece($7.99), and a beer batter sampler($11.99). 20 minutes pass and finally here comes our appetizer. The waitress throws the basket of appetizers on the table  and says \"here's your food.\" Very flat with a big attitude and walks off. The beer battered mushrooms were doughy and undercooked. We had a single half full ranch cup to share between us for the big platter and she avoided our table when she saw we needed more.\n***let me note that this waitress is giving the customers at the 3 tables surrounding us WAY better customer service. Even brought their food out in a timely manner with no attitude whatsoever.\nI decide to let the mushrooms slide for the moment. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand that mistakes happen, however this far into the experience I'm being mighty generous since it's a first time experience.\nWe finish our appetizer and we wait and wait and wait and finally she comes by and takes the platter returning 10 minutes later with our wings. She makes no inquiry about the broken open, clearly undercooked, mushrooms still sitting on the platter.\nI got the 12 piece with a single half full ranch. Again. Food on the table, doesn't ask if we need anything else which is something she is doing for other customers. at this point we have been here for about 40 minutes.\n\nI got half regular and half thai flavor. The wings were NOT jumbo. They were puny. The flavor was good for the thai, and the waitress even stopped by to check up on us, though I wouldn't consider walking by quickly and saying in your flat attitude tone \"youguysdoingalright?okaycool.\" Really all that helpful since she came and went so fast it took me a second to understand her. I had to reiterate for my girlfriend.  When I started on the regular I bit into my drumstick and had to fish a feather out of my mouth. DISGUSTING. It was that point that the entire experience was completely and thoroughly unacceptable.  The wings were soggy because they batter them or something on top of all that.  At first I had no plans other than to pay for the meal and leave the waitress 2 pennies and be on my merry way. But when the waitress came and asked if we needed a box I said no with 6 wings still on my plate, OBVIOUS SOMETHING WAS WRONG, again. She was going to take my stuff and make no inquiry to right the situation. I asked for the manager. Took a minute but finally the manager came over (mind you it is still pretty dead, what are these people doing I wonder?) I explained the food issues but blew off bringing up our treatment by the waitress. Normally I give the benefit of the doubt on this one but it was blatantly obvious that we were being treated differently with a different attitude than other patrons because we are a same-sex couple. Like our table had a contagious disease that prevented us from getting food in a timely manner, and getting drink and condiment refills too, regardless of the *empty* cups on the edge of the table. It wasn't like we were off in the distance. She had to walk by our table every time to communicate with the surrounding tables.\n\nAnyways. The manager experience wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't going to pay for that meal after the feather thing, and she comped everything. BUT only after slightly arguing with us about the undercooked mushrooms, which by the way come frozen which  makes the fact that they weren't cooked all the way acceptable I guess? Don't know. Don't care. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!\n\n2 stars because they did comp the meal, the waitress got lucky. If I would have had to pay for anything she wouldn't have gotten a tip due to the attitude but we left her $4 anyway since we didn't have to pay for the meal.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.\n1 star though for the overall experience. Same-sex couples, steer clear. You aren't welcome there and it's obvious.","date":1394906864000}

MexiCali has a number of great options.\n\nMany options here can be made vegan by holding the cheese. I absolutely adore the marinated tofu burrito. The tofu has a wonderfully chewy texture, and along with the black beans, the meal packs a protein-filled punch that will leave you full well past dinner-time, should you choose to finish it.  The sweet potato and plantain burrito is purportedly dairy-free, and it's another delicious, filling vegan option. The veggie tacos come with a spicier version of the sweet potato, the marinated tofu and some cabbage on doubled corn tortillas. The tacos are not as filling as the burritos, but they're a delicious lighter option. Finally, a fourth option for vegans: the guacamole burrito. They homemade guac is to-die-for delicious. \n\nI end up at MexiCali about once a week. I've been going since they were just a lunch truck 8 years back.

The best part I have to say was the dessert. We got cafe au lait panna cotta with mini glazed donuts, which reminded us of beignets at cafe du monde.

They have 1 type of sauce with mild, medium, hot spiciness. It's similar to angry crab's \"trifecta\" or boiling crab's, \"the whole shabang\" but with an Asian twist. It was good in my opinion.\n\nLastly, if anyone has ever gone to angry crab, hot n juicy, boiling crab, should know that the price range is similar. Heck, if anyone has ever bought raw seafood at the store should know that it is on the expensive side. Expensive? Yes. Overpriced? No. I have been to many seafood places similar to this and it's a decent price for what you get. My advice for the Dungeness crab, since it did happen to me at other places and I saw a review on it here, is to share it or get their other selections that they can measure out. The dungeness crab is a full crab so finding a 1 lb dungeness crab is not common. \n\nWould recommend and go again.","date":1500419097000}

Yuengling lager was the first beer I've ever truly enjoyed and remains in my top five favorites of all time. Smooth, sweet, cheap, it's like me in a bottle. I love that the bottlecaps can be rusty, I like that the taste varies per batch, I even like its relatively low alcohol content. \n\nThe tour was pretty great, the British tour woman was funny in a non canned way. She took a shine to my grandpa and was constantly begging him to sell her his hat (signed, sports, I haven't a clue). I was amazed at how close they let you get to the active equipment, I could've spit in the mash and no one would've been the wiser. The whole facility reminded me of St. Pete Catholic High, 50's cinderblock with a residue of toil clinging to the walls. \n\nThe tasting, that's what you came for right? Fantastic. They were out of Lord Chesterfield, but who drinks that? I \"tasted\" the shit out of the lager, probably 6 times. It makes sense, the bar is next to the gift shop and I went a bit insane in there. \n\nThe fact that Dick Yuengling made it a point to hire back the laid off workers after the last closure bumps it up a star.

I haven't written a Yelp! review in a very long time, but after my experience at All About Hair, I felt compelled to fire off a five star review about this gem of a place. Needless to say, I've found my barber of choice and they've made a long-term customer out of me.","date":1335654958000}

The casino reminds me of old casino, when they relied on millions of lights bulbs, neon signs, and the smell of argon in the air.

Also the Fish bar is awesome to go and relax, since they have a 40 foot aquarium that wraps around two of the walls.

Callie's sensitive to that, and really understands how my hair grows and where it's going to move.   I think the biggest compliment to her is that, as I'm a once a month haircut kinda guy, my brother and sister told me they really my hair a full month after I had it cut with Callie.

This place got the job done. Unfortunately, all the hotels in Santa Barbara are pretty freaking pricey. A lot of the other hotels started at $400+ \/night.  This ain't Vegas where you can get something pretty cushy for $250. This seemed like a decent option on the lower end. Our rooms were about $250 a night. A lot of the other hotels in the area were already booked for the weekend or required more than one night to book. \n\nPros: \n-decently priced\n-clean and cozy rooms\n-charming exterior and grounds\n-relatively comfortable beds\n-bath and body works shampoo, body wash etc\n-free water bottles and fruit waiting for you in the room\n\nCons:\n-dated decor \n-toilet issues: The hook inside kept coming undone. I guess we decided not to get maintenance because we temporarily fixed it, but it kept coming undone so it wouldn't really flush. We were checking out that day, so we decided just to deal with it. \n- door was difficult to open without using a certain technique\n-no hair dryer, so bring your own\n-no complimentary breakfast\n-a bit noisy in the morning, but I slept fine. I guess the window in the bathroom was open or something for some ventilation.\n\nOverall, I still don't think I would've chosen to stay anywhere else in Santa Barbara, so BW Pepper Tree Inn was still a good choice based on the location of the bachelorette and price range.","date":1495779236000}

The taro flavor rocked my socks off. It did take a little getting used to though, as I had a mini anxiety attack every time I took a sip. Because I got it warm, it was in a paper cup and I never knew when a pearl was making its way into my mouth. As a result, I spent half my drink wondering \"is there one in my straw?\" It's totally worth the suspense, though.\n\nThe only thing that still troubles me is the music. It's just...not right.

Come along with me, as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...\n\nI step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean, bright, and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items. \n\nFirst, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there.

I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.\n\nAt around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.\n\nTHAT'S the unscrupulous part.\n\nCLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this.

My suggestion is they need to cook their meat longer and ensure it reaches optimum 165\u00b0F Temp, serve the food very hot temp to ensure bacteria are dead, and only source their greens and veggies from USA only sources. Avoid Mexico as they have big issues with water pollution cross-contamination.","date":1462586013000}

SO...one star means a lot! I haven't been as livid as I was leaving this fiasco of a restaurant in a long while. Reasons:  The server was on her cell phone from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out (about 90 minutes). She literally had it on her shoulder the entire time except to say, \"Please hold\" to take our orders. She was also the chef and cooked while talking on her bloody phone, as well. Service:  FAIL.\nMy pork leg was tender and good which constitutes the lonely little star you see above. My husband ordered the shrimp, which cost $18.99. He received 7 shrimp that would be in a bag of 31-35 count...the size worthy of a salad shrimp. Again, $18.99...and the plantain portion of the meal consisted of 2 plantains the width of a postage stamp. Ridiculous. I then ordered tostones because I knew he would never be full with that quantity of food. I had to get up and find our server to add to my order as she was nowhere to be found.  They were also ridiculously thin, were over salted with an almost breaded and deep fried consistency. Food:  FAIL.\nI was going to order a Cuban coffee but the server was so non-existent that I just gave up, finally.

I had the worst experience when we went today for brunch that I've ever had in a restaurant since I moved to Tucson 7 years ago! First, before even going today, I called to find out what the brunch entailed and when Rosie answered the phone I told her that I had a few questions about brunch, she told me to hold and never came back to the phone. I stayed on hold for 8 minutes at which I called back and spoke to someone else who just seemed like \"Oh Well.\" This brunch was organized by one of my friends, so choice in location was not something I had. We did have a reservation, but were pushed outside because apparently they only planned for one 8 person table and the other table got there a few moments before us and got to choose. The problem with this is that there were two people in our group that are allergic to bees, myself being one of them, and bees were flying all around our table, especially our food. At one point I had to get away from my seat and was not able to return to it for 5 minutes because the one been landed on my waffle and was not leaving. \n\nAt this point my friend and I recognized the danger for the two of us and asked to be moved inside to which we were told \"No.\" When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told \"Well, what did you want?\" That's when the manager came up, I explained the situation and he was going to put us at one table to which our waitress, gotten by the hostess came up and said to him \"I already to her that they could not move in here.\" What employee talks like that to their boss! The waitress proceeded to run outside and tell the rest of the group that we were moving at which point they decided to stay outside, which was fine by my friend and I, but that meant having to be separated from our friends. This, to me, is deplorable behavior on the side of the the waitress and management. The waitress who was supposed to be our waitress inside as well, never arrived to the table and never checked up on us. Needless to say, I had to get another waiter and he was so appalled with the way that everything was handled he told my friend to not give him a tip.

I found myself in the area again and decided to give it a try. I usually don't write reviews until I've been to a place a few times but I think my experience was a complete one. I ordered the special and sampled each type of chicken, the modern BBQ sauce, mac&cheese (which the woman behind the counter was very proud of), \na bananas foster pie, and the new hope birch beer. After finishing everything, I just wanted my $16.20 back. Individual reviews: \n\nThe chicken: It was very average and that is being generous. It wasn't incredibly flavorful but it wasn't dry so it could have been worse. \n\nThe sauce: It had the tang of a traditional North Carolina BBQ sauce, mustard and vinegar based. I can't eat mayo so I was limited with sauce choices but the mayo sauces were recommended. \n\nThe mac&cheese: Salty and mediocre. It combines all of the things I like but makes a mess doing it. The pasta was well cooked but the cheese and bacon combo made it taste like I just licked salt off of my hand without the nice shot of tequila after. \n\nThe bananas foster pie: The crust of the pie needs no improvement but the filling could use an overhaul. I use the term filling loosely because after biting into the flakey crust, I struggled to find the bananas. There was a thin layer of smashed bananas and cinnamon sugar at the bottom and 75% of the interior was empty space. \n\nThe new hope soda: The birch beer (the actual name of the soda escapes me at the moment but it is birch beer) was the highlight of my meal. Everything you would expect from a Pennsylvania birch beer and very refreshing, which surprised me because I normally don't like fountain sodas and prefer root beer.\n\nI gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 because nothing was horrible.  I think the concept works, the decor is nice, and the menu is good but they need to work on the quality of their food because it currently doesn't match the cost.","date":1399494278000}

I just wrote a scathing review about El Patron Pizza in Tampa for leaving unwanted and unwelcome fliers under the door of unsuspecting tourist here in Tampa.  I was going to use a lot of the same issues for this review of New York Pizza Grill, but now I'm not sure what to say, only to say it carefully.  I knew there was something not quite right about the greasy looking punk that was meandering in the hallway of the 4 star hotel where I am currently residing.  As soon as I saw the flier I grabbed my room key and went looking for this person.  In hindsight that was not smart, as soon as I got a look at the guy, I ran for the elevator.  Now, I am no shrinking violet, but this guy looked like he's slap his own mother.  After reading the other reviews on here, I guess I should be happy that this employee didn't turn around and attack!  My biggest issue with this business is that they litter the halls and rooms with these fliers.  They sneak into hotels, a place where you feel safe and after this, I don't.  It doesn't seem to matter where it is a 5 star hotel chain or a family run business.  I did call every one of the pizza place that do this, because I felt bad about complaining to the staff at the hotel, but after yesterdays run in with greasy guy for New York Pizza Grill, I had it.  I do not feel safe and I told management that, and the did call the police.  So, for the employee of New York Pizza Grill, if you get caught stuffing fliers under doors where you are not invited and do not belong, you are more than likely going to be arrested.  So when you are out and about making not enough to keep your car running, ask yourself if your boss will bail you out of jail.  I doubt it, they'll probably just get another less than intelligent person to litter, trespass, annoy and sometimes terrify, hotel staff and their guests.  There are numerous reasons not to eat at New York Pizza Grill, but I'm just tossing out a good reason not to work for them.","date":1486652365000}

The Operations Manager, David Fuller went above and beyond to make my stay unbelievably excellent.  We were met at the hotel and \"double\" upgraded to a Tuscany Balcony Suite at check-in.

The hotel concierge Roshid is a very friendly and knowledgeable concierge, they are very lucky to have him on staff. The housekeepers are great, the rooms are immaculate.

You have a freestanding tub, and a large shower and you can jump in between the two should you be so inclined ha ha. The decor is so attractive, incredible wallpaper, beautiful rugs, everything seems brand new and they keep it in perfect condition. This hotel is a must for anyone visiting Philadelphia. They make you feel right at home at the moment you step in the door. The pictures that you can get from inside the rooms are enough to make up your whole trip to Philly LOL. But if you want to get out and explore Philly you're only steps away from the Liberty Bell and a historical museum.

With some guidance from the staff I was able to select some delights. \n\nFast forward a few years... \n\nMy most recent visit was only for some pastries and a quick lunch, so I didn't have time to browse the huge selection of Italian delights. \n\nI decided to go with the Mossimo pizza. The toppings were fresh the cheese was bubbly! The crust was thin and baked to perfection. I wasn't expecting such a huge pizza- definitely big enough to share! And priced at just $14? A steal if you ask me!\n\nFor pastries we chose the Cream Horns; while they were quite pricy, they were certainly delicious. Likely made that day, they were fresh, creamy and flakey! Impossible not to over indulge! \n\nWhile visiting the Italian Centre I suggest enjoying a freshly crafted coffee beverage and a pastry. The perfect treat before or after shopping.","date":1422862644000}

She mumbled under her breath to go pick out a color then yelled across the salon that I was getting a mani and pedi. \n2) once I picked out my color I went back to the front and someone who came in after me was seated in a pedi chair, water turned on etc. to get service. Once she saw that I was standing in the front she got a chair going for me. The problem with that is there were no more nail technicians available to work on me.\n3) so now I'm sitting in cold water waiting for someone to come and do my feet. \n4) the pedicure started, she painstakingly dug into my toes (which I absolutely hate) and rushed through the Massage part of the pedi\n5) after it was all said and done, I find out that their prices have gone up! \n\nI used to come here because they have later hours and are open on Sunday's but after a 3rd terrible experience here I am not coming back.

Makes me wonder if Daniel O. went to the same place we did.\n\nThis is a great neighborhood byob place that provides welcoming service and excellent food at a reasonable price.  We started going here because numerous South Philly friends recommended it.  This is not foo-foo Italian.  This is not pretentious Italian.  This is \"let's go back and work our way through the menu\" Italian.  We found the specials to be good choices.  My husband's broccoli rabe and sausage was excellent, as was a grilled romaine salad with bleu cheese and pine nuts.  Both were generous enough to share.  Last time, sausage & figs was a hit.  If you are in the mood for a basic plate of macaronis with red gravy, you won't be disappointed either.  We had a great time with the waitress because my BIL brought a bottle of Great Wall wine from China (that was the 2nd bottle we opened) and that started a whole crazy discussion.  She didn't know us from Adam, but we left there feeling like regulars.\n\nIt's a very doable destination if you are on your way to a sporting event at the Linc or the Cit, or to the Spectrum or Wachovia Center.  For those who rely on public transportation, you can get off the subway at Broad & Oregon, then walk back a block to Broad & Porter.  Make a reservation, though because it can be a popular place.

The main reason we chose this location was because it was close to the Winspear, and open late (until 11:30pm on Friday and Saturday). I don't have any strong criticisms of the restaurant. I suppose, if anything, the menu may have seemed a little bit over-priced - at least for what I ordered. I had a Caesar salad with three 'jumbo' shrimp on it, which cost $15. The portion size did not seem to justify the cost and the jumbo shrimp were fairly average in their size, but the flavours were good and the ingredients were fresh. My friend had a soup, which looked and smelled absolutely amazing, and at $6 it didn't seem too unreasonable. She also had the smoked salmon Carpaccio, which looked very appetizing with its thick slices of dark rye bread and generous slices of smoked salmon and capers. The also had a couple of interesting beers on their menu that we were keen to try.\n\nI think if you're going to a show in the area and looking for a spot to get a drink or a snack afterward, this is not a bad option.

I love the place, it so cute with the farmhouse feel. It's really open and cute booths that offers some privacy. We had a group of 7 and it was a bit tight, but we were able to be sat right away. I ordered the pork belly gnocchi, and it was good, but not great. I felt it lacked texture. If the pork belly was crispy, it would have sealed the deal. My husband ordered the trout sandwich, unfortunately, he was disappointed that it was basically a 'tuna salad' sandwich. He did not enjoy it. For dessert, we ordered coconut macaroons, which were good. Co-workers had mixed reviews, but one ordered the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) sandwich, and he liked it. Will definitely have to give this place another try. Also, the use books for bill holders, so cute!","date":1468547076000}

The drinks themselves were relatively cheap ($2-4 for a 4 oz. sample. Most were $2, some were $3, and very few were in the $4 range), however the food was really over priced ($6 for a small cup of fancy macaroni and cheese? really?). For the beer lover, however, there is a wide variety of tried and true along with the new kids on the block from local, national and international lines. Also, if you like what you tasted, you can buy it on site, with a Sobeys\/Safeway liquor store right on site doing specials on the sampled brews. \n\nWe went VIP for this event, however I don't think it's worth it. What you get: a glass mug instead of a plastic one, a beer and food class ($2 value) and a beer seminar ($2 value). If you do it all, or really value the glass mug, go for it! But for me, who just did the beer and food class, it wasn't worth it. \n\nMy only complaint is for the venue, but for an event that size, you need the space. $16 for parking on top of your entry fee (though I guess most people would cab or Uber it there so you don't have to have a designated driver), and then you have to buy sample tickets on site. It gets quite expensive.","date":1433802361000}

Kiwi Nail has always done a cheap job trying to take shortcuts wherever possible.  But today I've had it and will never go back!  After getting the typical shabby job on a fill with French tips,  I accidentally smudged two nails really badly.  They needed to be repainted and I asked her to do so... I even offered to pay extra.  The nail tech came over to look and she pressed the clumps back down and painted right back over the mess (didn't even keep the paint in the lines) then slathered so much varnish over the train wreck that it was literally dripping down my finger. After my nails were dry enough to leave,  another tech rang me up and the receipt had no place for a tip.  When I asked,  he told me I had to pay tips in cash... Well it's lucky for me I didn't have any cash.  He said I will have to tip her next time.  NEXT TIME??!!  yeah right!  There will be no next time!

I really did. So much so that I went back to try it after a less that satisfactory first wax.\n\nWax 1- I had Despina, I think her name was. I waited a good 15 minutes after my appointment time for her to come and get me from the front. Ironic they have a 9 minute policy that if you don't show they'll cancel\/charge you or whatever. Anyway, as for the experience with Despina, she did not speak to me. Like at all. Made me feel super awkward the whole time, and missed a fair few chunks of hair. She didn't ask me anything about myself, didn't tell me where to sit or how she wanted me positioned etc. Luckily I got this one half price as it was my first time at EWC.\n\nWax 2- I booked 3-4 weeks later with Amy Jo (based on previous Yelp reviews). She was a lot friendlier (literally the only reason why I'm giving this 1 star) BUT way too sloppy. I think it's safe to say this is the worst wax I've ever had. She left half of my hair on right before Valentine's Day! I understand they can't get all the hairs all the time but a lottttt of hair right on top was left clearly visible to my waxer. My apt was at 3.45, I walked out of the building at 3.53. Really. This includes the time spent undressing, redressing, and paying. 8 minutes is not long enough for all of this. It went so quick that when she said she was done I was actually shocked.  \nI'm about to go to CVS and get some at home wax strips to finish the job... For $47+ I expect way way more. \n\nThe staff- Another reason why I won't be returning. The ladies at the front desk are generally rude and disinterested in showing any glimpse of good customer service. ALSO, I don't like being asked if I'm going to tip - can't you give me the card machine so I can do it myself rather than make me announce if I would like to tip and how much? \n\nThe hunt for a decent Brazilian wax in Philly continues- someone help me PLEASE!","date":1455230697000}

The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. \n\nApparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.\n\nI decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.\n\nMy friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.\n\nMy boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. \n\nMy friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp \"En Cocotte\" with lump crab meat, roasted jalape\u00f1o cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.\n\nI have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.\n\nEven with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.\n\nOne wasn't enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.\n\nAll that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging. The front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it. I couldn't have asked for anyone better.","date":1369837740000}

I had no prior history or knowledge of jewelry, especially not engagement rings. Foolishly I visited a handful of those cookie cutter mall shops. Boring. Pricey. Nothing special. Blah.\n\nA co-worker told me about Gemological Resources Inc (GRI) and the wonderful experience he and his now wife had with them. Since it was a local shop I gave them a shot not knowing what to expect. Wow.... What a great experience! \n\nFrom the moment we (my girlfriend and I) walked into GRI, it felt right. We met with Terry initially to get a feel for GRI's work, as well as to discuss ring options.Terry is an encyclopedia of knowledge; it was a true lesson on everything we needed to know about diamonds, rings, etc. Very much worth taking the time to meet with him. He not only shared much of his knowledge, but also listened and got a good feel for what my girlfriend liked. The initial meet was a success and I felt confident that GRI would be the right place to go once I was ready to make the decisive move solo.\n\nWhen the time came I met up with GRI again, this time with Nirali who works closely with Terry. Because I wanted a unique, special, one-of-a-kind engagement ring I decided on a custom design ring. The CAD images and designs were perfect! To top it off, Nirali found me a high quality and very well priced diamond; this after I spent weeks personally searching for the right diamond. I was sold!! \n\nA reasonable deposit and a couple of weeks later the ring was finally in. Wow oh wow!! It was perfect! 100X better than anything I've seen before. GRI knocked it out of the park! Seriously! Fast forward a few months later.... My wife loves her ring and goes goo goo over it everyday. We had our bands done by GRI as well and they too are perfect (the wife's band was also custom designed to match the engagement ring).\n\nAll in all it was a GREAT outcome. We are both so very pleased and happy about our experience with GRI. Beyond our expectations. Never have I had such a relaxing and pleasant experience. I truly mean it. It always felt like I was meeting with friends and not just a standard business transaction. \n\nSo do yourself a favor... If you're reading this it's because you're thinking about buying jewelry. Save yourself the hassle. GO DIRECTLY TO GRI. I highly recommend them.","date":1408908087000}

The second place was a home daycare so she didn't turn over herself, and the other place was a mother and daughter run joint as well. They had very little turnover. That's important to me that employees stick around. So, my kid has been flourishing both emotionally and academically. She's picking up things that I'm totally surprised about....

He then asked me to pick and put in my own sugars from a cup of packets as he stated \"I wouldn't know what and how much you want, I only drink my coffee black.\" As I considered this incompetent statement, i expected him to then put more hot coffee in to help the sugar dissolve. But no, he proceeded to fill the rest of the HALF OF THE CUP with milk. And then handing me the drink he told me I'd better stir it to mix the cream and sugar in. Not sure why I'd paid such a high price to practically make my own half-coffee half-mild beverage, I simply smiled and walked away. I ended up throwing out the drink as I could hardly even taste the coffee and I'm not too fond of a lot of milk in my coffee. Nonetheless, the cakes were delicious, and I will be coming back with the hopes that this new business is still in the process of improving itself.","date":1445569519000}

The first night, we weren't told of specials (ugh, saw them on the way out and would have ordered them!), and my friend's appetizer order was wrong. Drinks were not refilled often enough, and the waitress seemed uninformed about some of the items.  The next night, different waitress.

The rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy.\nThe steamed dumplings could have been great. The tasted homemade and the filling was good. However, they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling. Everything else went downhill from there. \nThe beef and broccoli was inedible. The beef had an awful weird texture. Like it was boiled and was gelatinous.  The sauce on it had off flavors. We literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out.  The meat in both the general Tao's chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures. It was mushy and the coating was thick on those as well.

F.Y.I to anybody considering the pure rewards program the redemption items are not that great. It took me about a year of collecting just to accumulate enough points for a true blood key chain and when I got it it was placed in a bubble mailer and not even in it's original packaging. Needless to say when it came time to renew the card I opted out.\n\nAnyways to sum it all up I will say for selection and speedy service these guys get five stars but the prices as well as the sometimes slow ordering process drop it down to a 3. Still worth checking out though if you have been on the hunt at smaller stores for a particular movie or cd.","date":1432686742000}

Now it's a few days after Christmas and my husband Guy points out to me that the coat is really wrinkled. I go on line and look up every possible hack to get wrinkles out of pleather. They all fail miserably. I just went back to Ross with that coat, no receipt, no tags and asked to speak to the manager. The manager is a young male with dark hair and black framed glasses. I tell him of my plight. He literally says go find what you need, no problem. WOW! You won't believe it, but there was my Camouflage coat, in my size, hanging there waiting for me. Oh the irony!

Places like this remind me why.  We sat at the counter and watched the guys make the pizzas.  Our son hates cheese on a pizza and they had one already on the menu for him: The Marinara (oregano, crushed san marzano tomatoes, garlic, olive oil).  It was simple... but delicious. If you like real wood-fired pizzas that char the crust (a little blackened... in a good way), this is the place to go to.  Our other favorite pizza joints that rival this place are Lombardi's (NYC) and Grimaldi's (Brooklyn).  We all had a slice and were shocked at the lovely simplicity of it. Razor thin slices of garlic dotted the fresh tomato sauce.  My husband and I shared the Salsiccia (fennel sausage, roasted fennel, tomato sauce, mozzarella).  Roasted fennel on a pizza?  Brilliant. I cried a little.  No wait... I REALLY cried when we shared this cocktail: The Brooklyn (Dad's Hat rye, Luxardo cherry, white vermouth).  It says it serves one, but they brought it out in a cute little bottle and gave us each a glass...each with a hand- crafted giant square ice cube (hipster-cool) and Luxardo cherries.  Perfection.  We also shared a Rotolo (pizza dough, mortadella, ricotta, pistacchio pesto).  Those are crazy amazing.  I kept saying my husband could eat the rest... then freaking out and going back for another bite. He's lucky I didn't stab him in the hand with a fork to fight over the last bite (to be fair, he was the smart one who ordered it).  I could've eaten several of those and forgotten the pizza (although that was wonderful too!).  We finished with a little dessert... perfect little Italian cookies (\"Cookie Jar\" - pignoli, almond cookies, chocolate biscotti, pistacchio gnocchi) and I got an Affogato (fiordilatte soft serve with a shot of espresso).  The soft serve is Italian sweet cream... decadent and lovely... with rich espresso in a pretty little Italian mug.  I'm in Heaven here.  I know nothing about Vetri's other restaurants, but I'm checking them out next time I'm in Philadelphia!  By the way... service was great and friendly.  5 stars all around!","date":1401142826000}

I got the Bloody Mary and it was a great size for the price. It was spicy and hit the spot.\nThey text message you when your table is ready, so were able to walk around the quarter while we waited. Thank god a lot of restaurants are getting rid of the those buzzers that make you feel like you are under house arrest. \nWe sat down to a beautiful table right by the open shutters. The servers, were ok. They were busy, but forgot a couple of things we asked for. It was still a great experience though!\nI got the pork chop with red beans and the turtle soup. The turtle soup was one of the best I have had. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the read beans were seasoned very well. It came with cornbread, but it was very dry. After this lunch at noon, I didn't find myself hungry till it was basically time for bed. It was a very generous portion and well worth the money.\n\nMuriel's is a great way to get a classic, good quality New Orleans meal at a decent price.

Small, trendy and bustling with activity. They do not take reservations. Which is somewhat annoying when you are traveling from another part of town. Whatever, we just had to arrange to arrive earlier than we would have liked to hopefully secure a table, which we did. When we arrived it was quiet and only several tables had guests seated. As our dinner progressed it became more crowded until every seat was filled. Nice lively scene except then you can not hear squat! It made dinner conversation difficult. Boo!!!! I think this could be an easy fix for them. \n\nMeal\/Drinks:  The cocktails were creative and tasted wonderful. Our servers suggestions were pretty spot on as we enjoyed most of her suggestions. \n\nThe guacamole was very good with the exception of the fact that my friend has a nut allergy and we asked to have them left off and of coarse they arrived with them on! They really weren't necessary in my opinion either as I don't think they add much to the dish. The reason I wanted to try this restaurant- The Harvest salad! We all split this as well and it was good. The combination of fruit and root vegetables was delish! The figs were so good and the herbed goat cheese mouse was a highlight on this plate!\n\nTwo of us ordered the Veracruz Trigger fish and the other ordered the Serrano Scallops and all of it was wonderful. The white sweet mashed potatoes were interesting! I am glad we tried them. The Veracruz sauce was wonderful and full of flavor. It was a lot of food though. Had we known we would have probably skipped one of the first course selections or split an entree. That'a ok though- lunch for today :)\n\nWe also tried the Tostones and Stewed Black Beans. Beans were very good, full of flavor! Tostones seemed very dry but maybe that is what they are supposed to be- this is the first time I have had them. BUT, dipped in the Stewed Black Beans they tasted great!\n\nWe passed on dessert as they had no gluten free, dairy free options. Delicia offers many options for restricted diets, which we loved. Just no dessert, which is probably better anyway-we were so full! \n\nGo, you will not be disappointed. Just go before 7pm on a Friday night to ensure a table.","date":1375539288000}

Panini was amazing. Great use of garlic. Loved the cut of the meat. Not stringy but nicely chinked in thin slices. Cheese was well melted throughout the mix of kraut and meat. Rye Bread was wonderful. Would love to have it as a staple in my house. \n\nSalad came out same time as sandwich which was not good.\n\nPresentation was a little sloppy. \n\nLike every other place I have had a panini (except Panera where they do it right), the sandwich was served directly on a plate. Why don't they serve on a napkin? Particularly when they bring the salad out at the same time as the sandwich?  If the sandwich sits for more than a few moments, the bread gets soggy from the steam.  Nothing serious, but for the price, which is a little high, it seems lacking.  While the price is a little high, i think it is justified considering the food and drink quality. \n\nThey have a great selection of wines and beers that are likely to fit any palette.  \n\nWait staff have always been friendly. But you can tell this is a place where people are expected to hustle. Sometimes short or even distracted the service can be lacking. \n\nThe second time I visited was during a medium lunch rush and the wait time was 15 min to get drinks. My trip tonight it was about 8 min. For a sat night this is not bad. But not great either. My bartenders were awesome and never left me wanting (except for getting my salad with the main course).\n\nOverall a good experience and I will be back.","date":1300586892000}

I wonder how many people know that an Ouzaria is?  The ambience here is definitely upbeat - I'd rate it a great place for a group or first date.  They have a couple of semi-secluded tables in the back room that keeps it from getting too loud, but it's not a quiet romantic place.  \n\nWe brought my Mother-in-Law, who enjoys good food as long as it's not too weird.  I guess my wife is about the same, now that I think about it.  We tried three tapas plates; a three-cheese sampler, featuring feta, goat cheese and kasseri cheese, greek meatballs and pan-seared scallops.  We liked all three of these dishes.  The scallops were especially good - big and tender.   For tapas, they were pretty big portions, so keep this in mind.  The waitress suggested ordering one thing at a time, but we didn't heed her advice and ordered it all up front.   Two at a time would probably be a good idea.  Along with the tapas, we ordered a traditional Greek salad, which ended up being the lone clunker, surprisingly.  We just didn't like the dressing - too sweet for our tastes.  The gyro meat was fine, though, so maybe we'll just get a gyro next time.   One more thing:  The Spanish granacha (can't remember the label) was excellent for just $6 and a nice pour. \n\nOkay, now for the belly dancer:  She was cute and a good dancer, but I think this is just something that requires more alcohol on my part.  We did have a few laughs about it, though.  I opted not to get a dollar out to stuff in her skirt or whatever.   Fun but a little awkward. \n\nI've been to a few other Greek places in town that had better food, but for a night out, Momo's is definitely the choice.  We'll be back.","date":1349707040000}

The price: Expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive. They charge $35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport. Our room was roughly $275 a night. It's an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon, a Godiva Chocolate store, about 9 restaurants and a few bars. But you'll pay dearly for any of those things - like $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. The hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you $15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown Nashville area. \n\n2. The service: We called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes. We went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour. We waited around to ask the concierge questions. And each time we got, \"I don't know\" as the usual response. The cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6:30 a.m.\n\n3. The name: They call this place a resort but that is, by far, a misnomer. This place is a convention hotel, period. It's horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time. Our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day. The walls are thin and you can hear *everything* happening in the neighboring rooms. (eww!) If you want to relax at a resort, don't stay here because with all those convention people, loud cleaning staff, 24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress.\n\n4. The size: It's no joke that you will get lost in this hotel. It's inexplicably large. And when it hits noon, you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up FAST. With several conventions happening at one time, getting a \"quick bite\" is not possible here. And there's not really any place close by, either. You can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk - getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes.\n\nI'm sure glad I was there for a convention and didn't pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel.","date":1209499425000}

I tried the mandatory Dan Dan noodles. They were very flavorful and not too spicy. Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal\/star breaker.\n\nThe service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I'm sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized.

The calzones are a good size, but they were a little skimpy with the meat fillings. Probably the most disappointing part was the dessert- we got the apple pie calzone, and it just had a really weird spice to it- something other than cinnamon that I couldn't put my finger on. It also didn't have that many chunks of apples inside- it was almost pureed apple.

But in comparing this tattoo shop to the others around Indy and how they've jacked me around i decided its simply worth it to give 5. The other places have cancelled on me at the last moment, even when i was en route to go get the tattoo, one guy didnt even remember me when i called the day before to make sure we were on schedule for the tat and yet another had the inks set out and asked me to sit down when he got a call that he needed to go pick up the kids at school - all of these places i scheduled months out in advance as well. So, here we are back at Metamorphosis where they actually like to run a business the way it should be. Honestly i have only had one tat done here by Trevor and at the time it was the most fun 4 hour rib tattoo experience i could have had. They act professional, not like the rock star wanna be's i tried to check out at other places. Just cool chill people who want your business here. Trevor gave me the tattoo i wanted in the place i wanted it even though i feel he would have given me honest advice if it were needed. When it came time to get the tat, he held his appointment and i was treated with respect and as though a customer should be treated. Honestly i dont think this place cost more than any other place where youll get good work. Prices are about average in my opinion for the quality of work done. Dont waste your time going to the other places and getting jerked around - ive already done the work for you. Its a shame too that they may have good artwork at other places but youll feel like less of a human going anywhere else. The artists are just as good here and youll be respected for your $.  And by the way, yes they do ask for a non refundable deposit so they know your serious which is no different than any tattoo place ive ever been to.\nHopefully they dont change up anything, especially their roster as i believe they have a good thing going here.

So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \"why are you here. I have better things to do\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \"Hey man, what can I get ya?\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \"We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\". The manager says \"Sure.\" The guy then says, \"Can we get few beers down here\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \"Sure!\" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \"Hey, just shout and I will get you something\", or \"Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! \n\nLong story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.  Maybe if you get a table it's different.","date":1529425025000}

My expectations were far exceeded - and it definitely surpassed my last 'professional' hair salon experience.  Plus, the shampoo smelled amazing and the girl was really thorough.  I wish I had brought more cash to tip her!!!  The only thing you should keep in mind before going is time.  I had to wait an extra half an hour and it was the longest haircut I've ever had.  I would much rather have the student take the time to make sure it looks good, however, than have someone do a half-ass job.

Coming from TN, I chose to purchase this vehicle from Glanzmann due to its limited availability and attractive price. I communicated with sales on numerous occasions before committing to purchase from Glanzmann nearly 1000 miles from home.\n\nThe process was overall quite simple, though I felt we could have gotten alot more done regarding interstate complications prior to completing travel plans to purchase the vehicle. My only actual complaint stems from the vehicle's description. As an out of state buyer, I was at the mercy of the sales team to accurately describe and depict any conditional issues that might be of interest to a prospective buyer. Unfortunately, none of the issues with this vehicle were highlighted, depicted, described, or otherwise demonstrated throughout the entire sales process. I even asked the sales agent to, while on the phone, inspect the vehicle and describe any possible imperfection so that I could have no surprises upon arrival. I spent several hundred dollars in travel expenses to collect this vehicle, only to discover there were a number of aesthetic defects that deserved attention (large dents, cracked paint, cuts in leather). I had limited time and opportunity to react to these conditional flaws and purchased the vehicle - I had already flown from Nashville to Philadelphia! \n\nThis is obviously a small family-owned dealership. I expected a considerably more honest and direct interaction and was disappointed with the outcome. The automobile is a fine machine, but the defects certainly take away from the value. Mr. Jeff Glanzmann, I implore you to make honesty your #1 policy.  I had the opportunity to purchase the same vehicle, with honestly similar defects, from a dealership in Atlanta for the same price. I opted to purchase yours, incurring not-insignificant travel expenses, because of it's immaculate description.","date":1349714758000}

For entrees, we ordered: 1) jumbalaya pasta, 2) blackened red fish and 3) canal street red fish. The jumbalaya pasta lacked flavor and was our least favorite (would not order again). The blackened red fish was just okay and the skimpy side of saut\u00e9ed veggies (spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms) were VERY salty (would order again as a LAST resort). The canal street red fish wasn't great but my friend would order it again. Her biggest complaint was that it had very little garlic sauce. We also ordered paddle boat drinks, which tasted good but were more juice vs alcohol (had to order an extra shot).\n\nSo, overall, we were underwhelmed with the food, making it a solid 3 stars. On a positive note, our server, Alexander, was great...very hospitable and tried his best to make sure we were satisfied.","date":1483331360000}

I read so much about it on Facebook and the likes......so reading and seeing the yummy pics; well I just knew it would be all that.....untill yesterday.....\n\nMe and my bf Vince went to BlackFinn for Sunday lunch yesterday. The atmosphere was cool and it was really nice inside. The staff was pleasant as well, so I'm thinking \"hum...I like...\". We ordered  a couple of mojitos and we also had another drink, which was okay.  Time to order; I ordered the Cuban sandwich, hold the mustard, and add mayo instead....with Black Finn fries and my bf ordered the Prime Rib sandwich with au jus and the same fries.  We got our order, which took a bit of time but it was okay. Everything looked so yummy and I knew they were going to meet my expectations. Now mind ya, my bf put off going to BlackFinn since they day they opened and I've been on him to go here. So anyway, the fries were a bit salty, but good. I had a choice of two dipping sauces, which I believe were ranch and barbeque. Delicious! I bit into the sandwich and what did I taste? A mouth full of mustard!!! Eeewww!! Okay, did I not say \"hold the mustard\"? So lo and behold, my food had to be returned while my bf ate his food. His beef about his sandwich (no pun intended) was that there was more bread than meat. I looked at it and I noticed the same thing. Also, the au jus was a bit low as well and wasn't enough for the sandwich.  So I'm like the little old lady from the back-in-the-day commercials saying \"Where's the beef?\" LOL. Wow! \n\nFinally, after he finishes his sandwich, my food finally comes out and guess what? They left the swiss cheese off the sandwich. WTF! Okay, so at this point I'm like \"forget it, just take it back.\" How many times must I send my sandwich back to get it right? Now I must say that the manager on duty was accommodating and she took care of the check and apolgized for the errors. So for her professionalism and the fact that the staff was very polite, I give them two stars. Will I go back....yes I will give them another chance to redeem themselves, but all in my ear is my bf saying that there must have been a reason why he hesitated to come here and this is why.  Oh well......","date":1342485539000}

It was such a wonderful experience! Please hear me out!\n\nMy mission on this review is to get the word out! A friend and I went spur of the moment and I'm glad we did. From the outside of the building you wouldn't know it was a hookah bar (except the giant sign of course lol). The moment you open that giant wooden door, the decor and paint color gives it that authentic look. Warm yellow paint with evil eyes and giant metal wall lamps with cutouts shining red surrounding all the walls.\nWhen you go up a few steps there's a gift shop, a table, and the register. They ask you to take a seat upstairs and they follow you shortly after. (There's even another upstairs that I barely peaked at).\nThis is the amazing part: cushions on the floor with giant metal mandala tables!!!! It was so authentic I could barely handle my excitement. They have a menu with drinks, food and hookah. Water was only a dollar which was amazing because hookah bars are usually pretty pricy.\nWe smoked \"sex on the beach\" flavored shisha. It was smooth! Very smooth! We even brought bubbles for the trip to have a little fun :)\nWhat I like about this place compared to other loud hookah bars is that it wasn't even close to being hectic. I felt like I should have whispered at first, but after awhile I was more comfortable. Only one other couple was there and they were very nice to talk to as well. The older man and the young guy was extremely nice. The younger dude checked in on us and was sociable which was really kinda nice but not overbearing. \n\nIf you want a low key, quiet and chill hookah bar, this should be at the top of people's lists.","date":1461393337000}

I knew that.  Neither was Rotier's.  But my handy Yelp app had assured me that Fido's was open.  Imagine the disappointment when I realized there was a very real possibility that no burgers would happen on this trip down to the Deep South.  Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   \n\n\"We can try Burger up,\" I mentioned.  \n\n\"Why don't you just call them?\" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  \n\nTrue.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: \"What was her name?  She sounded hot.\"\n  \nMe: \"Paige.\"\n\nViper: \"Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?\"\n\nMe: \"Good point.  At least we have that going for us.\"\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.","date":1325618776000}

Great instructor - very hands on. \n\nThe room is TINY, but luckily there were only six or seven of us in the class (it was a random class in the middle of the day on a weekday).

The batter is fine, but it gets wearing. The coconut shrimp and hush puppies were definitely overcooked, which was kind of disappointing. Coke Zero on tap, but the mix could be better. For the price, it is also worth nothing there is a ton of food here, definitely quantity over quality.

Also absent was the plethora of seafood over ice you would hope to see at a place specializing in seafood. There were some frozen crab cakes, breaded fish fillets, clams, and crabs- but not else.

Mussels are one of those things I like making at home, but it is way too hot for that right now. . My main complaint is that the order came with an unacceptable amount of closed shells - 9!   It was still a good sized order with a big piece of bread to dip in the unexpectedly spicy, broth. As the place is to-go only- they know how to wrap up messy seafood orders, nothing was spilled.\n\nRemember when I said I didn't want anything fried, well that's not ever actually true.

Long story short, I scheduled an appointment online to have the transmission and differential fluid changed on my pilot. I arrived on time, and I was told it would take approximately 2 hours for completion, I also said I wanted an oil change, but \" full synthetic\". He said it would be $20 more, I said okay. When it was finally done and I was ready to check out, my advisor (Brandon) give me the total cost, which was double than what I expected and paid for in the past. I asked him what was all done, he said, \"they completed a transmission flush instead of the regular drain and refill\". I told him that's not what I wanted or asked for. He went on to say \"it was good for the car and whatever\", like I'm some kind of idiot. First of all Honda doesn't recommend doing a transmission flush and secondly, its almost triple what you would normally pay for a standard transmission fluid change. On top of that they didn't even do a full synthetic oil change it was just a blend. I didn't have time to argue with him because I was already late for an appointment, but I have the email showing what I originally asked for, so I'll be calling my bank soon.","date":1502876292000}

Bathrooms and water park were immaculate. The lifeguards were attentive and friendly. \nA star was lost because I found the water and air temp to be a tad too cold. The park was smaller then other indoor water parks I've been to. Only two big slides, one group slide, a couple of younger kids areas, lazy river and a simulated surf area. They would periodically close the big slides in order to open the surf area, for lack of staffing. A minor annoyance since that is why we were there. \nI can see how people  would be upset paying more and sharing the park with hundreds of others.

But when my friends suggested to meet them here for brunch this past weekend, I trusted their better judgement.  In the end, I'm glad I did.  This cozy Center City spot not only serves an amazing (and dare I say, a contender for the best) brunch in Philly, the staff really make you feel at home.  They really know how to wow their patrons: fresh food, delightful presentation, and so many delicious sounding choices it's hard to choose which dish you want from their one page menu for mains.\n\nTheir specialty, and they're not shy to tell you, is the Cyprus Breakfast.  It's a mediterranean twist on the classic combination of eggs, meat, and starch.  The plate comes out with two sunny-side up eggs, fried in olive oil and garnished with fresh parsely.  It's served alongside a grilled slice of lounza (Greek ham), two pieces of salty, crisp fried halloumi, warm bread, and tomato, cucumber, and onion salad.  The menu also features a spread of other traditional Greek, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern specialities: Avgolemono, Moussaka, Pastitsio, Shaksouka, and Malohwa to name a few.  They even serve Greek Coffee and Frappes!\n\nThe service may be a little over-attentive in an attempt to make you feel more than welcome, but it's much appreciated, especially when other restaurants fail to put as much effort into the service as they do the food.  One other tip: reservations are highly recommended, if not required.  Because of Kanella's small space, getting a table at brunch is nearly impossible if you're not on the list.  But if you can score seats here for brunch, then expect nothing less than a stellar way to start your weekend morning (or recover from last night's activities).  Can't wait to come back and try out the dinner menu.","date":1297629561000}

The menu isn't extensive, but it's got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches, salads, and soups.  \n\nTheir Cuban Sandwich ($10 w\/ side) was pretty excellent.  The bread wasn't the traditional panini-style, but a French baguette...it was still great and had a little crispness to it.  All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance.  As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this.\n\nI also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w\/ side, extra to add ham\/turkey).  It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right.  A side salad was also done well.\n\nFor my side, I chose their \"spicy carrots\" which sounded unique.  It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic.  The spice was just enough to be pleasant.  I would definitely get these again.\n\nOur food came out super quick and our service was great.  I'm looking forward to trying a couple more items and bumping this up to 5 stars.","date":1426740893000}

I went to Las Cazuelas for the first time for my birthday.  We had a wonderful time.  I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila, and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends, and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus, the food here is delicious. \n\nI'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations... \n\nThe guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entr\u00e9e had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. \n\nI should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  \n\nThe prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price, and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!","date":1391629204000}

The flowers around the sign make it an #instaworthy post for sure, and when the weather is nice, the outdoor seating must be gorgeous.\n\nInside the Cake Shop will take your breath away, light airy colors and flowers and twinkling lights. This isn't the kind of cake shop you do take-out at, you'll want to sit and enjoy. \n\nFood: I wanted to try the Raspberry Champagne cake, unfortunately one wouldn't be ready for a little while, so I ordered a slice of the Red Velvet  Cake. The floral icing work was so perfect I didn't want to touch it, but I had to because come on it's cake. What I assume must have been cream cheese filling in the middle was decadent and I never wanted the cake to end. ***I felt one slice was plenty for two people, it's HUGE\n\nI was torn between the Rose Cappuccino and the Lavender Latte. I went with the Lavender Latte, hot, and it was stunning, it was a creamy, smooth, not-at-all bitter latte and the hint of lavender was enough to taste but not over powering, it was probably the most perfect coffee I've ever had in my life. \n\nPrice: the coffee is pricy, $6, so not a regular coffee stop for me, but for #treatyoself it's the way to go. The slice of cake was $12 but like I mentioned, it was enough for two people and for how amazing it was, I think it's so worth it.\n\nCustomer Service: I mentioned Disney initially because the friendliness, care, and attention of the staff felt just like Disney. They were kind, they helped me decide what to try, and the barista even offered to make me the rose cappuccino if I didn't like the lavender latte after trying it - how sweet! \n\nI will most definitely think to come here if anyone visits and wants something sweet. This place has my heart and is a hidden gem to anyone who has a sweet tooth!\n\nCheck out my #FirstTimeFriday highlight of my visit to The Cake Bake Shop on my Instagram @jordanqjordanq for pictures of everything mentioned above!","date":1538672329000}

Never really that busy (but they should be). Staff is super friendly and attentive, Price is low if you are looking at the over all picture and compare it to the worth. THIS PLACE IS SUPER CLEAN!!!! Which in my opinion is a good way to judge a quality restaurant.... and this place is spotless. Not kidding at all on this,,, you could literally eat off the floors in the bathroom. Spotless.\n\nIf you live any where in the Tampa\/Brandon area, do yourself a favor and check this place out...

I love the indoor patio dining area because it brings a bit of the outdoors in a quiet indoor setting. \n\nOn my first visit, I ordered from the dinner pre-fix menu which is a great deal (appetizer or soup + entr\u00e9e + dessert = $40). The seafood gumbo soup was hearty and delicious. The dijon mustard encrusted salmon was cooked perfectly. The bread pudding was a great way to end a delicious meal.\n\nI returned to Muriel's for lunch on another NOLA trip and tried the wood grilled pork chop. The pork chop was flavorful, tender, and moist. I was not too crazy about the red beans and rice it was served with as I found it a bit bland. The entr\u00e9e was served in a bowl but should perhaps be served on a plate since it was difficult to slice the pork chop since it kept sinking into the bed of red beans and rice. \n\nMuriel's is one of the places I would love to return to because of the ambiance and the great food.","date":1432625376000}

Modern office, computerized charting, accurate scheduling (I was never kept waiting), the ability to make an appointment at short notice to get something looked at, convenient location. Can't think of anything that's lacking. She shares her office with another doctor who I haven't met.\n\nThe second category is the personal aspect. When I showed up the first time as a new patient, she spent a good deal of time with me and I got the feeling she cared about me as a person. Sweet. In all subsequent visits, that never changed. Without going into medical details, she herself called me when the results came in for some minor (and false) tests. \n\nAll in all, I can't imagine a better doctor.

Friendly staff who seem happy to work there!  And getting a wave in the ALWAYS packed parking lot is indeed a common occurrence.)\n\nGripes:  Parking.  I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  \n\nGripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.\n\nMajor points for:  \n*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  \n*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!  Some stuff is cheap!\n*Selection!  Good choice for candy, chips, snacks, healthy snacks\/protein bars, drinks, etc.\n*For the MASSIVE VOLUME that the store does, the lines usually move very fast and efficiently, and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed!\n*The store is clean from my point of view.  It is a busy, busy store, but I never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station.\n\nI do not eat any of the hot food.

We rented a Pontoon boat to go spend the night on Anclote Sandbar. Our group was 3 adults and 2 kids. The staff was very friendly and informative of the rules to follow for safety.  We paid to have a porta-potty available on the boat since we were staying the night. If you're just going for the day I doubt you'll need it. \n\nTheir website is REALLY informative. And you can read about other people's experiences too. What I found useful were the stories about people who didn't follow directions and had stuff happen. Understand their mistakes and you won't fall into that problem. You WILL pay for emergency services. You WILL pay for broken equipment. You would charge someone accordingly if it was your business.\n\nWe had a great time camping on the Sandbar and would do it again without question.

It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible.","date":1453046035000}

It was not a simple process as both phones required a thorough diagnosis but I was truly impressed by how patient and accommodating Guy was with us.  He worked on my tween's iphone and he walked her (us) through the process step by step and educated us on new tools on the iphone.

Always wanted to try Ol Brady's. Ordered take out and while picking up I was excited about the great smoky aroma in the restaurant. Excited I was I hurried back to the hotel. We ordered the combo platter w\/ 3 meat choices. We had the 1\/4th chicken, Ribs, and pulled pork with a side of green beans hoping they would have mac and cheese but didn't happen. Why only one side with a dinner like this every one else has two?? For $2.25 you can order another side our side was coleslaw a little 5oz serving. Make it quick the food had good flavor but all was dry. The BBQ was not smoked that day. Could tell it was all reheated. Sampled all 3 bbq sauces all were good. Also ordered brisket sandwich, they have two sizes ordered the large with a side of chips wanted to sub the chips for a side they told me they don't do that. Sandwich is loaded with beef not sure it was brisket though. Like to see smoke rings on the sliced brisket which I could not see, tasted a little like pot roast . I will try to eat there once again when I know that day they are smoken fresh Q . \" Read less","date":1403907679000}

There were some high highs and a few lows. \n\nFor the table, we started with 4 of the small plates for $16-- the hummus, the hot potatoes, the olives, and the pickles. The hummus was incredible and a really large portion. The hot potatoes had great flavor but were served in a tiny bowl-- each of us was able to only have one small bite. The olives were served warm and were quite tasty. The pickles were a-okay, but I probably would not reorder these. \n\nFor our mains, my mom and I split the trout, my husband had the roast beef sandwich, and our friend had the burger. The trout, in my opinion, was overly charred and lacked seasoning. Also, it was a whole trout, which, to be fair, is stated on the menu, but I do wish that the server or waitress would have explained a better way to debone the fish or offer to do it for us. We ended up with a weird pile of fish after we butchered it. The highlight of the trout was the potato gnocchi salad served on the side. OMG it was INCREDIBLE. I would order the subpar trout again in order to get this gnocchi side. \n\nMy husband did not like his roast beef sandwich. I think he was expecting more of a French Dip, and this was more of a cold cut sandwich. The tomato on it was mealy, and he found the onion jam to be a bit too sweet. After a few bites, he gave up and focused on his side of kale slaw, which was very tasty. (The manager did take this off the bill).\n\nThe friend had rave reviews on his burger and fries so those are a big thumbs up. \n\nThe manager came around to check on our meal, and we gave him his honest feedback. He seemed appreciative and brought out two desserts-- the brown sugar panna cotta and the peanut butter banana whoopie pies-- on the house. These desserts were definitely highlights so I would recommend saving room for the sweets at the end.\n\nService overall was fine for the first week. Some low points were that my drink (the Outsider) took 45 minutes to get to me and tasted strongly of lemon. Our waitress also took away our apps before they were finished-- this is a huge pet peeve of mine, especially because the olives, pickles, and hummus could have been used to jazz up the flavor of the trout. \n\nOverall, I'll definitely be back and look forward to them working out their opening week kinks.","date":1450644598000}

This is a hole in the wall and not a place that you come to sit and enjoy your meal. It's really best to take it away, because the dining area is usually a little dirty.\nFamily-owned and -run, there always seem to be the same people (and, sometimes, their kids) behind the counter.\nI mainly come for the tamales, tortillas (voted Best of Tucson for a couple of years, and they include one with most combo meals) and flautas. Man, those flautas... They also have what I think is some of the best salsa in the city. Not too spicy, well-balanced, nice color, good consistency... like a fine wine. I'll usually save their salsa cups for use with other Mexican food that I get later.\nIf you like fake cheese nachos, then this is your place. But do yourself a favor and tell them to hold the onions because, otherwise, you'll find one has exploded in your container and it will take you two days to get the taste out of your mouth.\nThe best part about this place though is the price: cheap, cheap, cheap! Most of the combos run about $5 and include an entree, rice, beans, one tortilla and a couple of salsa cups. I usually make myself a little bean & rice burro when I'm done with the meal. Good stuff!\nI'll only recommend this to some people, if I know that they won't be offended by what a sh*thole this place is. No, honestly, it's a really crappy building. But, if you can get past that, then you'll find the food to be great.","date":1242915554000}

The \"grilling\" process did not sear or seal the tortilla, and there were no grill marks or cheese melting that would evidence any type of honest grilling process.   \n\nThe idea of eating room temp eggs and chicken really weirded me out... but I had a bout $8 bucks invested in this roll of disappointment, I was already at my office and did not have an alternative breakfast...so I begrudgingly ate most of it.\n\nIf I go back for breakfast, I will stick with the smoothies.   those seem to be easy enough to pull off and very nutritious.","date":1458306643000}

It was clean, quiet, close to all the sights and everyone we encountered was very helpful.\n\nThis hotel is beautifully decorated, it features a nice inside courtyard with atrium and there is art work throughout---it isn't rundown and beat up like many of the other hotels.  They have done a great job keeping this establishment in great shape.\n\nWe had no issue with street noise and we stayed on the second floor, on the Girod street side.  Housekeeping did a great job freshening\/cleaning the room everyday and my son's loved the rooftop pool each evening.  They also have a very nice fitness room as well, and all the equipment was up to date and functioning and CLEAN.\n\nWe didn't dine in the hotel bar\/restaurant, but it looked very good and there was often great aromas wafting into the common area when we walked by.\n\nI brought my own mi-fi hotspot so I can't attest to the internet\n\nThere's lots of things to do near the hotel that aren't the standard French Quarter sights.  So, be sure to check them out.  We enjoyed going to Fulton Alley one night during Happy Hour for some great family bowling and across the street there's BARCADIA which has loads of old school 80's video games and other cool games for patrons.\n\nI highly recommend this location for families and singles!","date":1408985386000}

My friend and I made the mistake of coming here after being famished after a long day. Hey Johnny Rockets, I understand that you guys can get busy, but a quick acknowledgment that we existed would have sufficed. After finally waving down a waitress, we finally got a menu with a heavy sigh on the side as if we were troubling the staff. I urged my friend that we should probably leave, but we had already waited long enough, so I reluctantly ordered.\nI got the original burger and fries as did my friend as per usual. Don't get me wrong, the burgers and fries are decent but definitely not worth the wait or hassle. Even the chocolate shake that I ordered was pretty good with a good consistency, but the taste of bad service still lingered and eventually overpowered the chocolate flavored concoction. Needless to say, I will definitely not be coming back to this location if it continues to be managed so rudely.","date":1363690912000}

Everywhere I went in the hotel itself, staff were happy, friendly, and welcoming. This wasn't the case only with me and it did not come across as fake or forced. I am a people watcher, so I observed the staff interacting with several guests and they were consistently good service providers. \n\nThe Red Owl Tavern has great food, and generally great service, but while I was there for brunch, there was one server behind the ready-to-eat bar in the Tavern that was in a bad mood, unfriendly, aloof, or some combination of all three. She did not acknowledge people when they ordered-she would just turn around and start getting what they asked for. She also got into it with another server who apparently experienced the same rude attitude I and my fellow patrons did. I cannot emphasize enough that almost every other person there had a great attitude and was more than friendly. One bad apple...ironic since she has red hair. I realize that the Tavern is likely under different management, but it does affect a hotel guest's experience, and in my case, it did so negatively. \n\nThe only reason I can't give the hotel 5 stars, however, has nothing to do with the Tavern. It is because our room was not touched once we checked in. Not one time. It was immaculate upon arrival, but that was the last time I saw it that way. I shouldn't have to call the front desk for either a daily once-over or turn-down service. To be fair, I in fact did not call the front desk, because I was running around almost the whole time I was in Philadelphia, but that's exactly why I wanted to come back to a tidied room. This is an oversight I did not expect from such a great chain. \n\nThe Monaco included all of the amazing features of a Kimpton hotel. My dog was warmly greeted everywhere we went in the hotel, her dog bed and bowls were already in the room, and the decor was, as always, remarkable, interesting, and quirky. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful, and the complimentary drinks in the morning and for happy hour don't hurt!\n\nOverall, probably one of the best places to stay in Philadelphia. It's a new hotel, so I'm sure the housekeeping issue will be addressed in time. Just growing pains.","date":1359398560000}

The special place Cactus holds in my heart is for one thing: Margarita Mondays.\n\nI walked in to Cactus this Monday with a friend from work, and the bartender had a pitcher of 'ritas going before we even sat down. Point to Cactus: The staff is on top of stuff for their regular customers.\n\nThe service can be a little slow at times, but once we get a table full of margarita pitchers life is beautiful. The 'ritas themselves aren't the most consistent (this week's were a little heavy on the juice) but for $10 I'm not complaining. And, to reply to one of the posts, they definitely don't skimp on the tequila. In fact, the bartender measures out the liquor for ever pitcher. Margaritas are pretty sweet so you can't taste it too much, and I'm sure it isn't quite as much as you'd get in a non-special, but believe me it's there.\n\nMy most serious gripe, actually, is the music. Don't know who puts the mixes on, but I protest. They actually played 'Closing Time' the other night - at 10:00, when people were still coming in. Way to send the wrong message.\n\nIt's not the best place around by any stretch, but if you ever need to unwind after a long Monday, you'll find me at Cactus.","date":1273853769000}

Ours was located on the 5th floors right next to the elevator with a very small window overlooking the court yard. It smelled like a basement. The only positive things I can say was the pillows were fantastic and the lady who came for turn down service was very sweet. \nI think this hotel needs to instill some sort of quiet hours if it wants to set themselves in the genre of classy. Having drunk frat guys making there presence know at all hours of the night is ridiculous. \nI also found out after our stay that my husband had requested a bottle of champagne to the room that was never brought.

The restaurant was completely empty.  We inquired if they were even open and a nice lady said they were and proceeded to seat us.  \nTheir menu did not offer as many options of meat types or dishes as most Mexican restaurants do here in Indianapolis.  My husband ordered a margarita and the special of the day, Chilaquilles con salsa verde y pollo at $6.99 and I ordered a carne asada burrito at $7.99 and water to drink.\nChips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were  fried there, and while I like that style of chip (thin, often bubbles into thin layers) but were cold and very greasy.  Salsa was sweet but had some heat in the finish.  It was easy to eat a lot of those!\nWhen our meals came to the table, frankly, they were underwhelming.  My burrito tortilla looked\/felt like it was not heated at all and cutting into my burrito was disappointing.  There was lots of lettuce and tomato, a scoop of a white rice (not spanish rice) and there was supposed to be mozzarella cheese in it but couldn't taste or see it.  The carne asada was thinner than a strip of bacon.  Unfortunately, I would be generous in saying there was maybe 2 ounces of beef.  In all honesty, there was no more meat in it than two strips of bacon, diced.  My husband mentioned it to the person (owner) with a quick \"sorry\" muttered and no offer to do anything.   While the combination of ingredients was not improperly prepared, there are 100 other Mexican restaurants in town I can spend $8.00 on a burrito and it would be generously filled with meat.\nAs for my husband's chilaquilles, I order this all the time from Biscuits in Broad Ripple and this was another disappointment.  This was chips, salsa verde, one fried egg and a very thin boneless piece of grilled chicken.  My husband felt as I did.  Not poorly prepared but completely lacking any substance.  During the time we spent in this restaurant, there was not one other customer coming or going.  With the lack of substance to the food, I suspect most people will feel as I did and would not waste their time coming back here.  There is no way this restaurant can survive when prices are the same as other Mexican restaurants but quality is far less.  Sadly, I was even mad that we spent $25.00 at this place and left just to drive to a fast food restaurant so we could get some quick, cheap protein.  \nI will chalk this up to a learning experience.  Folks, save your money and go to Rosita's or Margaritas U.S. 31, Leonardo's or even El Meson.","date":1484435845000}

This cafe had good reviews, so we figured to give it a shot.  We were seated right away and the menu had a ton of options to choose from.  The food was mediocre breakfast food and affordable, but nothing out of this world.  We probably would have considered to go back if it weren't for the service.  Immediately after our food was brought to our table, the check was placed down, never asking us if we were going to want anything additional.  We sat down at 11:00am, the food came out pretty quickly, but by 12:00pm we were getting kicked out of our seats by the owner.  There were about four open tables for the older women that wanted to sit down, but for some reason it had to be our table.  I could understand if we were holding up the table for hours while there was a line, but there were several open tables and only 5 people (not groups) waiting to be seated.  We were meeting up with friends we had not seen in a while and it was unfortunate to be rushed out after only an hour.  Needless to say, we will not be back!","date":1393198117000}

We were never greeted after we were seated. We had to ask the Maitre'd if we could get some water and he could not have been more rude and offended that we had asked. Once we finally ordered, we were out of water. After asking for more water three separate times it finally arrived. And from that point until after we received our food, we never saw our waiter again. I asked the bus boy for another glass of wine which never came. Finally the waiter brought it over after we had finished our meal and when I told him I didn't want it any more, he gave me attitude saying he had just seen the ticket. Not my problem! We were never asked if we wanted dessert, we were just presented the check at which point our waiter told us we didn't need to leave a tip since we were clearly displeased with our experience.

However, a few years after, I noticed a \"Collection Notice\" on my credit report. As I investigated that, I realized that the Lincoln Green Apartment had reported me to Collection Agency for what they said \"  150 Dollars fee for not washing the carpet\". They had never contacted me although they had my new address, email, and phone number. They reported me to collection agency for only 50 dollars.

The show is a little pricey but it goes to a good cause and it's neat to be in a space with so much history. Go if you can and be ready to stand! You can also buy tickets online that are more expensive but they reserve a seat for you if standing isn't your thing. Also I think the first 30 folks or so in line got seats as well. Kids sit on cushions in the front.","date":1515544586000}

Of course, the hotel remains in construction which is an inconvenience, but manageable. The front desk is located on the tenth floor which makes it difficult to get help quickly.

The elevators come once per hour and are almost always full, so you might as well get some exercise and take the stairs. The pool seemed too vacant (probably because the \"front\" desk was right in front of it). The rooms were quaint as they served their purpose, a place to sleep. Definitely not luxurious, but towels\/soap were always cleaned and replaced. Our AC unit was faulty and we had to call for the hotel engineers to be fixed, but it remained operational after.

My husband and I met in Santa Barbara so it was only fitting that we got married in a place that reminded us of where it all began. One of the things I loved about the venue is it's rich history in Santa Barbara and how beautifully the architecture and gardens photograph. The staff at the Riviera Mansion are top notch and really created a premium experience for us, from the first email we sent to Breanna to the walk-through, the tasting, rehearsal and the wedding day itself! We felt so well taken care of throughout the night- they checked in on my husband and I and our parents throughout the night to ensure we had our favorite drink in hand, got to taste all of the appetizers by putting a special plate at our dinner table and kept our champagne topped off for all of the toasts. One of the big selling points for us was that the venue included a lot of the basics like catering, bar, dinner rentals, bride & groom suites, and different ceremony and reception sites. I was grateful to be able to get ready, take photos, have a light lunch before the wedding all onsite. The venue itself is BEAUTIFUL and so dreamy. It was just the right amount of space and with all of the different room kept things interesting for our guests and allowed people to spread out across the different rooms and patios. I would highly recommend the Riviera Mansion to anyone looking for a classy, iconic and romantic wedding venue in Santa Barbara.","date":1506911309000}

I created a Yelp account just to write about how horrible the service is at this Cosi.\n\nI work nearby so I have ordered here many times. I recently learned that there was an online ordering option, which I thought would be perfect because I am busy throughout the entire day with appointments and don't have a lot of time to wait and order at Cosi, especially during their busy hours.\n\nA couple times I have online ordered there were no issues. My food was ready when it was supposed to be, and I was able to avoid the long lines. The other times, the service was horrible. When you online order, the estimated wait is always 20 minutes. I always give Cosi 25-30 minutes to make sure everything is ready so I can just pick it up after prepaying online. A few times I have had to wait 50 minutes total from when I online ordered because the employees did not look at the online orders as they were coming in to prepare them. My question is, what is the point of online ordering if it takes longer to get your food when you online order than when you walk in?\n\nToday I online ordered from Cosi. Not only was my order not ready after 30 minutes, but the service was horrible and the employees were incompetent. I went through the normal line and told the employees I online ordered. The employee, without checking my online order receipt that they should have already looked at, asked me what I got because they clearly had not made my order yet. I was ordering for multiple people so I told him I couldn't remember, so he went in the back to get my order receipt which is what he should've done earlier. I ordered coffees so I went to the coffee counter while I was waiting for my order to be prepared. There was an employee busy preparing someone else's order so I stood there waiting. An employee from another register asked if she could help me. I told her that I had 2 coffees with my online order. She then said okay and just STOOD THERE. I had to ask her, \"So should I just go back to the register I was just at and wait for someone to help me with my coffee?\" She said yes as she continued to stand there not doing anything. So I went back to the original register I was at and the woman who was still busy preparing an order asked me what I needed. I told her that I ordered 2 coffees. She then asked the employee who I had just talked to and was not doing anything to prepare the 2 coffees! The employee who was now helping me did not understand the coffee sizes. The coffee sizes online are grande and gigante, and she didn't know what those meant. Don't use those coffee size names if your employees don't even know what they mean. In the meantime, the person who was preparing my food order had to come ask me again what I ordered while showing me my order receipt. He clearly did not know how to read the order receipt, which honestly a 1st grader could understand. He asked me if I ordered 2 squagels, and I said yeah that's what the online receipt you are showing me says. I honestly would have just complained to the manager instead of writing this Yelp review, but I had a 10 AM appointment and had been at the Cosi for 15 minutes and had to run back to make my appointment.

Seen the NY Times article. Nevertheless I was skeptical. Mainly because most people have at best, two reference points for donuts, Dunkin Donuts or Krispy Kreme. Neither of which really makes truly great donuts.  So after waiting for the crowds to die down a little, I traveled over to see for myself last Saturday.\n\nIt's a small shop that blends into the surrounding neighborhood. Inside there are a couple of seats at the counter and a wide window well that two people could sit in. I ordered my donuts. I went with the Indian Cinnamon, the caramel banana, the pina colada, and the halva pistachio. The ladies behind the counter worked as fast as they could given the decent sized collection of people waiting for orders and bopping in. My order was processed quickly, and I got my coffee right after I ordered it. The coffee was one of the only things that was a disappointment besides the lack of seating.\n\n Since there was no room to sit, much less stand I took my donuts and coffee out to a park just off of Federal between 3rd and 4th St.\nThe donuts were truly transcendant.  Each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue.\n\nThe Indian Cinnamon-Very light on the cinnamon, coated with sugar. Hot, fresh, and so moist that it pinched in half when I started to eat it.\n\nThe caramel banana-A delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than I\"d imagined.\n\nThe pina colada-The donut I though I'd enjoy the least. However it tasted like the Rach 3 and Beethoven's 9th all rolled up. A complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing. And unlike the current generations, I don't use that term lightly.\n\nThe halva and pistachio-the final movement. More subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well. I'd never had halva before, but I liked it.\n\nBelieve the hype. Believe the NY Times article. Federal Donuts makes some of the best donuts I've had.","date":1330567678000}

Too good to be true and yet it is!\n\nWith competitive prices, gas prices usually the lowest on gas buddy, and membership perks, such as travel getaway packages, I found I have always made back my membership fee and then some with the end of the year reward coupon.

Really, Trader Joe? Your stores are all over the place in other cities, like Chicago, DC, San Francisco......but southside Indy gets ZERO...downtown Indy NONE. That's not cool, Joe. Not cool at all. \n\nHowever, the employees are pretty useful and cool (and sometimes even funny). The food is affordable. I like that it doesn't take me 15 minutes to get through the store because it's petite. LOVE the products. Once I got a spoiled piece of salmon, and they cheerfully refunded me and I didn't have to bring back the gross fish. I like the free samples (last night I had a bite of pumpkin pie). LOVE that I can have a cheese party without going broke. Their low-budget beers and wines are fantastic for cooking and fairly passable for drinking if you need to buy in bulk and your friends aren't super snobby about booze. \n\nKefir, non-dairy milks, organic products, cheese are generally much cheaper here than at other grocery chains or gourmet stores. Their frozen foods are very good and the MorningStar Farms sausage links' everyday price is equivalent to the super sale price at other grocery stores. \n\nI am particularly fond of the somewhat-strange party snacks, although they are much pricier than at Saraga. \n\nTrader Joe's is a great place to find food to \"cheat\" with if you're not much of a cook or are pressed for time. For example, you can buy an already-seasoned tri-tip to use for your steak fajitas. You can find pre-marinated chicken to put on the grill. They also sell many pre-cooked foods that you just have to microwave...if you can't cook at all. \n\nIn conclusion, start writing letters, people! We need a downtown Trader Joe's!

I'm not applying this towards my overall scoring but I'm noting it so you know that I know that you know what the deal-i-o is.\n\nAtmosphere:\nDead silent.  Seriously.  So.  Freaking.  Quiet.  If you need to study then you've found a winner!  If you want coffee and a chat then you need to move it outside or to another spot.\n\nWhen I walked in everyone looked and stared not because they cared about checking out my style or anything but because I made an actual loud noise and it startled them.\n\nNot the largest coffee shop but seating inside for probably 30 at max capacity?  Chairs and tables not the comfiest nor the biggest. \n\nAfter I got my coffee from the huffy barista (more on that in the next section because I should really review the product & service I got) I chose a spot to read my new cookbook and just tried to enjoy the stillness.  That was great until the guy behind the counter started a very loud and very angry and very loooooong conversation with someone on his cell phone.  In a space that had up until that moment been as quiet as a church, his voice seemed like it was coming out of a loudspeaker.  Look, I'm nosy but I try to make it look like I'm not obviously nosy but it wouldn't have mattered here.  This guy really got into it and wouldn't have noticed if the roof fell in.  He certainly didn't notice the customers standing at the counter waiting long minutes for him to finish what was very obviously a VERY PERSONAL phone call.  After a few minutes I gave up pretending I wasn't watching and took in the show.  After ignoring the customers for a few minutes he finally ended his call, heaved numerous sighs and 'helped' them with the same care he'd given me.  Spoiler alert: it wasn't indifferent but rather seemingly downright rude.  I watched this play out with a steady stream of folks for the next 30 minutes or so and finally left because all of this was stressing me out a bit.  Not really relaxing, ya?\n\nService:\nI asked for a large coffee and was trying to decide if I wanted medium, dark or chicory when it appeared in front of me.  If you don't know what you want in the first 2 seconds then they'll just make up your mind for you.  Okkkkkkk.  I watched this happened to a few of the customers after me too.  This guy wasn't really needing to be dealing with the public because there wasn't obviously other stuff going on that made it difficult for him to his job.  Everyone has a bad day but don't take it out out on the customer to the extreme.  I mean, you don't have to kiss my butt but don't be all huffy and DO NOT PICK MY COFFEE FOR ME WITHOUT ASKING.  Rude.\n\nCoffee:\nIt was good.  Not great.  Not mind-blowing.  Good.  Not as hot as I prefer but more heat than tepid.  I ended up pouring about 1\/4 out because I got some grounds in the finish.\n\nI couldn't find spoons and after waiting a moment at the counter to ask (remember, my first time here) and being ignored I just used a straw.  I hate to drink fair-trade coffee that wasn't my choice poured by an angry barista and then throw away plastic when I don't have to.\n\nOther:\nI didn't eat so no word on that.\n\nBathrooms were clean enough.\n\nGreat restaurants nearby.\n\nI really should give the spot 1 star but the cleanliness of the main room, the overall neighborhood area and the outdoor seating bumps it up a notch.  Just know your fair trade coffee can be served with a buttload of snark.","date":1494685353000}

However, I had a couple of problems with the professionalism of the staff which is why I rated three stars instead of five. I can't help but make this personal and say that I wasn't treated with equal warmness and courtesy because of my appearance. Coming from a red eye flight, I arrived at the hotel with sweatpants and frazzled hair. I do have tattoos and I'm in my early twenties so I felt like the staff regarded me as not as significant as the other guests. I had a couple of rude stares initially and when I visited the executive lounge (which requires a key) for some breakfast I received an almost, \"Who let you in?\" look from the woman serving breakfast. With that said, the room service operator seemed quite irritated whenever she took my orders but the actual room service deliverers were quite friendly, so I made sure to tip them well. Food and beverage could do some work, it's the not the worst but definitely not the best, especially for the price. I had free wi-fi with my stay, so that was very nice and convenient. Overall, I would stay again at the DoubleTree in Center City just because my stay wasn't awful but the staff definitely needs to brush up on their services techniques and courtesies. Just because someone is young and underdressed and has tattoos does not make them less worthy of respect. My money is as good as anyone else's.","date":1431459825000}

So I went down and told the person on the reception about it and she told me that a engineer will come soon to fix it.\n\nAfter 20 min no one came. I had checked in with my family and it was a very hot day (max temperature: 94 degree Fahrenheit). This time I called the front desk and the phone was busy. I tried it few more time and I got the same result.\n\nI thought let me get few more stuff from my car and then call them again. So when I was passing through the front desk on my way to garage I thought of talking to the receptionist. I found no one there. I came out of the hotel and I saw the receptionist smoking and chatting on her mobile!!\n\nEventually the engineer came and told us that there was a leakage in some duct. So we were moved to another room where the air conditioner was working.\n\nNext, the ice vending machine was not working on our floor. I tried it one floor below and again it was dysfunctional there. So I had to go to the second floor to get some ice.\n\nWhen we came back to our room next night (after spending the day in an amusement park) we found that the room was not cleaned. The bed sheets were in the same condition when we left in the morning. The trash was not emptied. The shampoo and conditioner were not replaced.\n\nPlease don't waste your money here.

When it arrived 20 minutes later, the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end, and medium to well the rest of the cut - and I had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash. The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry, so I chomped my way through.\n\nAnother steak was over-cooked, a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato, cold shrimp on a fourth, and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.\n\nThe manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate, but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table.

He did this with every dish he cooked, reusing the same dirty spoons to taste, stir, and serve everyone's food. We reluctantly ate our food anyway. It was tasty, but we both got sick the next day. Will never go there again. I would have said something to the head chef, but he was present in and around the kitchen the entire time, so I had to assume he saw this too and did not care.","date":1457317558000}

I will elaborate.\n\nBrisket was absolutely perfect! Tons of flavor, super tender, some fat (but that is not only expected, it is desired) The BEST!\n\nRibs were also super moist, and very flavorful. I read that some reviewers had dry ribs. These were seriously excellent. There were so many BBQ sauces to try too. I have to say that there was little need to put sauce on it... yes, that good.\n\nPulled pork was great, a tad too salty, but by no means unpleasant like another reviewer stated. Very moist, great flavor\n\nThe chicken was a pulled chicken. I guess I should have been clearer and asked for BBQ chicken. The pulled chicken was good, but also a little over salted. It seemed to be white meat that was shredded.\n\nThey DO have collards (not on menu). And they were very good\n\nThe spinach was a bit better in my opinion as they had a generous amount of garlic and olive oil (very Italian) \n\nGarlic mashed were very good, Cole Slaw was also very good.\n\nNow that we tasted most of the menu, the standouts for me were the brisket, ribs, and spinach.\n\nAnother reviewer was disturbed by the Italian language TV channel. Seriously?  get over it!\nThe owner\/chef is Italian and speaks the language. This also explains why they also have pizza. I cant wait to try the pizza next time.\n\nWe both loved this place and can't wait to return, however weight is an issue.... so wait we will.","date":1450670020000}

Having had a date last Saturday, I thought it would have been a good opportunity to try it out. \nThe layout of the restaurant left some to be desired, as the host stand is at the back, and the place is very small save for the upstairs, but they were able to sit us almost immediately in the upstairs dining room which was small, yet charming, and slightly more roomy. A gentleman who I am guessing was the co-owner was very friendly and ensured our 8:00 reservation was filled and the wine poured. The service wasn't slow, though awkward. It seemed that our server was there when we didn't need her, yet not there when we did, though she had a very friendly demeanor and was not rushing us in the least.\nThe food was delicious, though a few things stood out to me as peculiar, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. This was a legit Italian restaurant, yet they had ravioli as an antipasto. Anybody who knows Italian knows this means \"before\" the pasta, not the pasta itself. Secondly, the bread, which was very good, came with butter, and not Olive Oil. Again, this was an Italian restaurant, not an Applebee's. \nFor our appetizer we ordered eggplant, which was okay. Was sliced a bit too thin, though this may have been personal preference, but in doing so was masked by the (delicious) red gravy and (addictive) mozzarella, which was very fresh, so while I may not have been tasting the eggplant, I was tasting some very delicious flavors. \nOur main courses came in due time afterwards, enough to let our eggplant digest, but not enough time to make us forget. I ordered the special, linguine in a light vodka cream sauce with salmon and capers, my date ordered the canneloni. Both were inspired. Not the gigantic portions known to most frequent Italian restaurant goers in Philadelphia, but just enough. The flavors were subtle, yet plentiful. \nWe did skip dessert in favor of coffee. I ordered a double espresso, my date a cappucino (I know, but she was cute, so it's okay). The waittress came out with a regular and double cappucino. Wasn't the end of the world, so I just enjoyed it, and it was good, but just speak up if you want an espresso. \nOverall I recommend this place, mainly for the main courses, but am willing to go back and give it another shot and give Porcini's their 5th star. I hope I can!","date":1354628322000}

We were pretty pumped to go here since we live right down the street and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Fat Ham a few weeks ago.  The food was good but not show stopping.  My major issues were with the service.  1 word.  Unbelievable.  We spent $180 on 2 people.  When you spend that much money on a meal.. You expect perfection with food, service and ambiance.  This place underwhelmed and now I have to deal with my fianc\u00e9 who is still raging with last nights experience.  Thanks Spraga.\n\nIssues:\n1.  Soups came before cocktails.  I finally had to ask a manager where our cocktails we're because it so long.  - not in my world if I'm paying $180!  \n2.  First course came while we were still eating our soup..so we had 2 plates in front of us on a cramped table.  Hello serving 101 at like the most basic restaurant in the world..Don't bring the next course when people are still eating their first!  Again I would expect shit like this to happen if I were at TGI Fridays but I wasn't at TGI Fridays.  I was at SPRAGA.\n4. The waiter tried to remove plates while we were still eating from them.  Say what?  Not when I'm paying $180 on a meal son!  You leave the plate until I am finished!\n5.  The waiter would awkwardly come to the table and just stand there.. Obviously we know he came to take our food order or dessert order but you say \" Is everyone ready?.. I'd like to take your order\" etc.  WTF.  Nope he just stood there... Weird!  \n6.  Empty glasses\/butter dishes left on the table throughout the meal.  Sloppy.  The server tries to take plates we are still eating from but leaves sangria glasses etc for the entire meal?  I just.  Don't.  Get it.  \n\nAll in all food was good, not amazing and I've had better service at Tangier.  If you are going to spend that much money go somewhere else.","date":1397924434000}

Seriously, it's been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.\n\nAnyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House's latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I'm sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.\n\nWhile we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn't even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I'm sure it will get better once they settle in.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more\/re-filled them during our meal.\n- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. \n- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.\n- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. \n- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.\n- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn't get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.\n\nSo to sum up, first visit (of what I'm sure will be many) was pretty good.

It was cooked to perfection.  I wish I knew what grinds of meet they used to create their burgers because they had the right amount of fat to keep them moist and where full of flavor.

It was great and I loved that the tortellini was al dente, and not the mush commonly found in soup. Finally I got my entree, the Pescatore, which considered of a mix of seafood over linguine. I chose the white wine sauce, and it was delicious. Oh, and how could I forget, the complimentary bruschetta and limoncello was the perfect beginning and end to our meal.\nI can't write this review and not mention how phenomenal the service was.

Oh goodness, it is a whole store by Duchess filled with the most amazing, well like the name says: Provisions!\n\nThere are cookie, cake and pie making equipment. A How-To kit for duplicating their famous macaroons. All the gadgets one would need to bake a masterpiece are in this delicious little side venture. They even have a wall stocked with jams, honeys, caramels, chocolates, nuts, salts, sugars and other high end, super must have ingredients to wow your taste buds (and show off to your dinner guests!) I bought a delightful crystallized honey as well as a jar of salted caramel that is so amazing it could be drizzled on a dust bunny and make it taste divine! I also added to my insane cookie-cutter collection, which I hide from my other half so he doesn't think I'm Kitchen Cuckoo! Oh, wait... I think he's on to me ;)\n\nThis is definitely a must visit store if you are a culinary wizard, or just like to wing-it!

I don't understand a Margaritaville in Nashville but I also am probably not the actual target demographic of these places...see: my dad who sometimes makes me think he can't find anything else on his XM radio other than Margaritaville. \n\nSo we've of course been to the one in the Caymans and on Key West. Since clearly these are out of the way places, I didn't get in the way of my parents having their experience here. \n\nI was kind of hoping to avoid listening to music...or at least if I was going to have to listen to covers, NOT \"Call Me Maybe\" gone country. It's somewhat loud in here and I imagine as the night goes on it's louder. We were here prior to a hockey game but it was still pretty busy. \n\nSince I procured my family a free app coupon I decided I was worthy of the 5 o'clock somewhere which is a take on a Hurricane, which somehow in five years of legal drinking I have never had before. It wasn't bad. I imagine it's one of those things where you're like \"oh this barely tastes like alcohol, I'll have another\" and then suddenly you're hitting on someone you shouldn't be hitting on. Wait what.\n\nFor that free app, we had the spinach artichoke dip. It wasn't bad, I certainly wouldn't have let anyone pay full price for it though. \n\nI wasn't feeling like having a full on sandwich or anything but there aren't really any smaller sized options. I guess a cup of soup but I had had soup for lunch and it was like obscenely hot for December so that was out of the question. I decided to just get the chicken quesadilla app and if I didn't finish it then whatever. The rest of my family had burgers or a chicken sandwich. The burgers were liked all around, although my brother got the diablo one and complained that it wasn't spicy enough. But I don't think he understands that poblanos aren't that hot.\n\nThe quesadilla wasn't bad, there were some spots though where the chicken was a bit tough. Nothing you can't fix with a good bit of salsa though. \n\nEven though like I said it was pretty busy, we were there only about an hour. Service was great. Would I come back on my own? Probably not. In my case it's really one of those places where once is enough for the experience but if I were asked to come again, I wouldn't say no.","date":1388287868000}

I stayed about 1.5 miles from the Convention center thinking a morning walk with a breakfast stop would be good for me. I went online and looked at reviews and picked a few spots along my route that I felt would be worthy of checking out for breakfast. As I was strolling along Magazine Street I peaked in the window of what I thought was a Pastry\/Cake\/Sweets stuff kind of place. \"BITTERSWEET confections\" For a moment I thought maybe they weren't open yet because it wasn't crowded with a line out the door like others I had passed.  Then I glanced over at the menu and I spotted the breakfast menu!!  I said to myself, give it a try, why wait in a line for 30 min elsewhere, you're right HERE dude. So I walked in and that is when my 3 day RELATIONSHIP started!.  Yep, it was so damn good I went back every day on my morning walk to the convention. Day one I asked to speak to the chef, a lovely lady FULL of passion about her food and family recipes. She makes a damn good Biscuit!! I wanted to apologize for not being able to finish my meal (Healthy Portions) and I didn't want anyone to think I was dissatisfied. She smiled, thanked me and said I'll see you tomorrow and tomorrow she did along with the day after. I could only finish half of my meal so on the remainder of my walk to the convention the next day I would find someone along the way who hadn't eaten yet and pass on the deliciousness of the day! It was a wonderful experience.  On my final day my local friend wanted to take me out for breakfast at one of \"THE SPOTS\", the convention was over and I wasn't on any schedule. We walked to the place she recommended (a very popular spot, with a very long line and wait). I said, I can't do this long line, let me show you a spot I found! So we took a nice morning stroll over to Bittersweet. BOOM!, another AMAZING meal, there was also a young couple that had come in for a tasting to pick out wedding cakes. I overheard them say they were on a budget with a humble look in their eyes. I can tell you from my seat they were treated like a respected customer who had deep pockets. I was thinking to myself if that cake tastes anything like the breakfasts I've been having these kids are in for a real TREAT!!

So because of that, the margaritas were half off that day, woo hoo!!! \n\nI forgot it was Cinco De Mayo and when I asked the waitress how much the margarita was, she looked at me funny for some reason. She kept on looking at me funny the whole time I asked her anything. The rest of the time she tried to ignore me for no particular reason. WTH? \n\nOn the bright side, the margaritas were huge and blended just the way I like it. They had lots of good flavors to choose from like pineapple, banana, strawberry, mango, and a few other fruity flavors. At the time we were there, only one other table was occupied. I got the fried grouper sandwich which is a popular fish in FL. It was just OK. The service was slow and the waitress was weird. She asked my husband if he'd like more water a few times but ignored me completely. I don't know why she was giving me an attitude as I wasn't rude to her at all. \n\nWhatever, mean woman haters like her suck. The grouper sandwich was $9.95. Fries didn't come with the sandwich and cost an additional $1.65. What a rip off! Fries should come with a full meal IMHO. The margaritas were $4.00 each. The soup of the day that my husband got was $5.95 for a large bowl. And the key lime pie which tasted like lime cheesecake cost $5.95. The inside of the place is cute and there is an outdoor patio that faces the beach. Also, there is a bar outside.

My friend ordered the chicken tenders and a basket of bacon cheese fries.  the fries were awesome and enough to be a meal by itself, the 12 tenders was enough food for 2 people!  overall, the food was amazing, prices were very reasonable for the quality and the amount of food, and the girls working we all friendly and nice to look at.  can't wait till i'm back for work and can stop in again!","date":1435957265000}

I was impressed with the decor and design of the interior which use to be a church many years ago. The building had it's 100th birthday in March and is located  Mid City in the midst of cemeteries, funeral homes and some residential.\n\nOur waiter Gregory N who formerly worked for a well known restaurant in town was humorous, professional and a native of NOLA. We started off with a bottle of Merlot and ordered the smoked deep fried soft shell crab and a cup of seafood gumbo. When the soft shell arrived I was taken back how large it was and tasted divine. The gumbo was also yummy and contained generous amounts of seafood.\n\nFor dinner I selected the Flounder, fried green tomato, and stuffed mirliton. OMG this entree was so delish. The fish was superb and the stuffed mirliton which was my first time experiencing and was delish. I can honestly say I experienced authentic Cajun food at Redemption. I sampled the stuffed gulf shrimp with crab stuffing and the taste was also outstanding. We ended our magnificent meal with the Crepes with Louisiana strawberries\n\nWhat's funny is how I stumbled onto Redemption's by dinning at their casual sister restaurant earlier in the week which is located in Prairieville - Tommy's Fish house. Christian who runs Tommy's recommended Redemption. \n\nWe had the pleasure to meet the owner of Redemption Marie and head chef Greg Picolo who were gracious to spend some time with us and make us feel welcomed. I must say that the seafood was the freshest quality and reasonably priced compared to several other high end restaurants we dined at NOLA.\n\nRedemption exceeded my expectations and I would definitely return here next time I'm in NOLA.","date":1367934848000}

Then, after telling him a very specific, difficult color scheme I had in mind, he worked with me to figure out how this would best accomplish the look I wanted and still be a good tattoo. And 3 and a half hours later, after staying 2 hours after the shop closed, Ruben gave me the best tattoo of the 6 I have.

The classic Romanesque architecture is as compelling in size as its design. \n\nFor my first symphony, I attended the free yearly symphony this past Saturday. Having a deep understanding of modern and contemporary music; my sense of audio innocence for this show provided a pure experience. \n\nDuring the first piece, I was overwhelmed by the senses of emotion from the insight into sounds surreal. Each successive song brought me to a different state of emotion. Sadness and pain - comfortableness - excitement and joy.\n\nThe acoustics of the hall are simply and totally consuming. You feel completely surrounded by sound. Although we sat directly center of the stage, we noticed that the balcony's were also reacting in applause in a similar manner. I bet the view from there is more amazing. You could then see each musician as they added their contribution to the influence over your feelings.\n\nWalking around the outside gardens, you really begin to notice the architecture. There are flowers and fountains adorning many areas of the facility. \n\nIts without saying, you must consider attending a symphony here once in your life. I still have little knowledge about who wrote what; the name of the piece\/song\/tune. However, I do know that the experience rivaled nearly every concert I have attend. And I have: There are many shows under my belt. \n\nThere was a new appreciation and connection to sound that I left with that transforming evening...","date":1255409520000}

I've been to the Capital Grill and I enjoy their beef as well as their service and decor, I just didn't want to spend $250.00 + for the 3 of us (call me cheap).  Not really knowing what to expect at the Marmont, we took a risk.  \n\nThe Good:\nI have to say that the NY strip steaks and rib eye were very very good and cooked perfectly (medium rare and medium).  They were about 1-1\/2 thick (forgot to bring my calipers) and well trimmed; very little fat was left. I would say the meat was prime, not choice.  We all enjoyed them as well as the fries which were cooked crisply as we requested.  the sauces were meh; why cover up the wonderful taste of the beef?  Service was good, prompt, and polite.   \n\nThe Not So Good:\nThe decor is awful.  The floor looks like painted OSB with the paint half worn off, the tables are painted plywood, lighting from K-Mart, and walls have a few giant old signs hanging on them.  The place is a visual dive. I felt like I was in a Tom Waits song.  How hard would it be to make it a nice warm and inviting space? I don't get it.   Want to make more money? Spend the 5K, it will pay off. But please find someone who knows what they are doing.  You serve delicious steaks; I'll bet your decorator doesn't do the cooking, so why ask the cook to decorate?\n\nIf you want great steaks for a good price, go here.  But if you are looking for a classy or trendy setting too, you may need to pay the extra 30% at a high end steak house.","date":1484433719000}

My wife ordered a grilled cheese and asked for some DICED tomatoes in it.  The young waitress repeated the order back and said of course- no problem.  I ordered the veggie bean burger and she asked how would I like it cooked- which was odd, but I added \"medium please\".  I ordered iced tea for my wife and me and added onion rings to my order.

My wife laughed as the entire burger fell out onto the plate splattering ketchup and mustard on my polo shirt. 5 minutes later the waitress reappeared and I explained that perhaps something had gone awry in the kitchen and she quickly brought me a new roll.  This one was mostly frozen... so I told her never mind- I'll just eat the patty and tomato\/lettuce.  The patty was cardboard but I ate it anyway... my wife was busy dabbing my shirt to remove the mustard\/ketchup stains when the waitress came back to apologize that the cook was overwhelmed by a party in the next room. (Odd, since there were only 8 or 9 cars in the lot outside.)  She was very timid about offering the explanation and I just accepted it as not totally her fault but rather (I assumed) an intimidating short order cook in the back somewhere.  Upon leaving, I advised the floor manager at the register very quietly about the roll and she made a face and took off three dollars from the bill since \"you ate the burger part\"... with no apology or attempt at customer service. The waitress got her full tip.   I was so angry that I vowed to open a yelp account and DID!  Avoid this place at all costs.","date":1431455642000}

The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today, saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me, I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10\/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter\/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway, the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away, especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed, literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time, not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people, except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life.

I'm admittedly fresh from an interaction with front desk manager Ali, who --when I asked why my room wasn't made up despite my  calling housekeeping, stopping by the front desk and activating the green \"make up room\" button -- behaved as though making the bed, cleaning the bathroom and replenishing the tea supply was far above and beyond the call of duty for a hotel despite a guest asking three times for them to do their job. In less time than I spent requesting the service, i could have cleaned my own room. Worse still she accused me three times during two conversations of likely not knowing the difference between the green service button and the red do not disturb button. A lovely housekeeper who was nice enough to come up at 2am to bring me tea and towels for the morning saw the green button was on.   \n\nNo one knows the hotel policies or amenities and I got a different answer every time I asked a question. \n\nThe binder in the room indicates that I can either use the in-room safe or a safety deposit box located at the concierge desk. When I asked the concierge to give me use of the safety deposit box, they said they had no idea what I was talking about and said maybe the front desk has that service. The front desk said there's no such safe deposit box and explained to me very slowly as tho I was a complete moron that im obviously confusing the box in my closet with a safe deposit box. No one has read their own guest binder. \n\nThe binder and literature also says there is a pool. There is not. There is not a even single place to sit or walk outside, and not just because construction is going on for the next 3 years. They could have provided some small deck or garden  area for guests to go for a breath of fresh air, since there are no balconies or windows that open. \n\nThere was turn down service on my first night here but not the second or third. Had they been providing what they claim to, they'd have been able to alert housekeeping that my green \"make up room\" light had been on for nine hours. I don't really care if my bed gets made, but if nothing is done despite the signal outside the door, \u00e0 call (and voicemail) to housekeeping and physical visit to the front desk where I was assured the room was serviced, that's just bad management. \n\n\nPost script: I was trying to sleep in after a late night and between 9:30 and 10:30 am the housekeepers were chatting loudly in the hall outside my room and in the adjoining room. I did not so much mind being awakened by their work, as much as terrified when -- after id dozed back off -- they repeatedly tried to open my door despite the red light being illuminated for DO NOT DISTURB. I called the front desk who put me in touch once again with housekeeping where I left a voicemail. It's like no one is in charge of this place. Not hospitable. \n\n The gym is decent and security, bellmen and casino personnel were all lovely.","date":1486628842000}

The man did the nails (which were fine\/good except for some acrylic on the sides which he fixed later) and then she painted them. The polish job was sloppy. I had bare spots on the edges, lumps (old polish?) and overspill onto the sides and cuticles. She did not follow up with polish remover to clean them up - instead, as she painted, she ran her nail along the edges to remove it. Not quality. \n\nI happen to like nail art once in a while - not every time - but sometimes I splurge. There does not seem to be anyone who does nail art well.

We were on a family vacation from Arkansas as this is one of the closest locations to us. The menu was confusing as they have fresh fish on the menu but if it does not have a checkmark beside it they do not currently have it. I wanted halibut but there was no checkmark. So I asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the snapper dish. So I ordered that. Then the server came back to tell me the snapper was still frozen solid. The chef recommended I get the red fish but I did not want that. So I got the swordfish.  It was good but I was disappointed.  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us. I said well get me a discount since you didn't have what I wanted. No discount and no manager came out to apologize for not having dishes ready to go for a Friday lunch. We will probably come back but are disappointed in this trip to one of our favorite restaurants.

The interior is amazing it's 5 star cozy lodge feel with nice fireplace. So much potential but really fell short...here is The Good The Bad and The Ugly.\n\nThe Good- as mention the interior is amazing, makes you want to back and relax all night long. Fish and chips was solid.\n\nThe Bad- Soooo... I have never had to eat a burger with a knife and fork... why did I have to do that you may ask? (See pic) the bun was so dry it crumbled into dust as I held it and took a bite. It was brioche bun that was way dry and appeared to have an egg wash on it which just made matters worse. I will say the burger meat, with bacon and English cheddar if eaten all at the same time was great, though burger meat by itself needed season.  \n\nThe Ugly- the coleslaw straight up had turned, it smelled like rotting vegetables in fishy water and tasted the same. I literally spit it out it was that bad.\n\nI am sadly seeing a food quality issue here, borderline need health inspectors to visit on that coleslaw.\n\nAlso side note if they had more local craft beers other then 2-3 on draft, an extensive bourbon list this would make a killer spot for drinks and drinks only until food quality is resolved. Wishful thinking as well but would be great if this was a cigar bar as the atmosphere is prime for that.\n\nPS- other people bitched about pricing but we felt it was very inexpensive. $51 for 2 meals, 3 drinks.\n\nI really hope they make some of these suggested changes sooo much potential for go to spot.","date":1485566662000}

It was good but I've had better homemade pasta at some other places. \n\nI have to admit, I expected to be there awhile since all the food is made to order but we were in and out within an hour & a half.

The space is clean and bright with tables in the front, and back. There is also counter seating. There was some nice use of wood on the walls which gave Spot a cool urban vibe design.\n\nThe people that work at Spot were very friendly and helpful. They explained the specials and helped us with suggestions. I was surprised that Spot has other items such as Fish & Chips and Muscles in addition to burgers, sloppy Joe's, pulled pork and cheese steaks. Mental notes for my next visit.\n\nI went with the Spot burger; which had hickory smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles, coleslaw and Spot sauce. This was a great burger. The bun was excellent, fresh and toasted just right.  The burger was moist and juicy. The bacon was great and the slaw and sauce really made this one darn tasty burger. My daughter had the Santa Fe with Avocado, pepper jack cheese, jalape\u00f1o, red onion, sun dried tomatoes and a slightly spicy sauce. This was also a really good tasting burger! Spot really shines with their use unique toppings and sauces. \n\nWe ordered the plain fries too and these were crispy and not greasy. They were very good fries but Sketch still has my favorite fries. We had a couple of Fanta sodas too, which was pretty cool. All of our food came out surprisingly fast.\n\nSpot is very high up on my burger list and very close to Sketch.

I on the other hand have had much help and felt welcome.  I have been going to this library every day for the past year.  Why?\n\nI am a school bus driver, from the Randolph County area.  I drive 20 minutes from my house to the bus yard, then pick up a student (Special Ed), and drive this student to a special school in the Belleville area.\n\nBecause of the low pay and long distance drive, I made arrangements with my boss, who is also the owner of the bus company, that I can stay up there, that the Library is only 2 miles from the school, and I would have plenty to keep me occupied.\n\nSince it would also save him fuel\/maintenance costs (making 1 trip as opposed to 2 trips), he allowed me to do that.  They have been good to me.  Yes sometimes it gets a little loud, and it has become a 2nd home for the less fortunate, but it has many great reference materials.\n\nIt is an old building, but I view the architecture as a work of art.  The second floor has a huge ceiling, with giant windows.  It is nice and open.  Thier reference section has shrunk down as they are re-arranging thier book set-up.\n\nThey have undergone renovations, and changed thier computer policy.  Now visitors can get 3, 30 minute sessions online.  The computer system is now linked up to all of southern IL, from Cairo to Effingham. \n\nIf you have a library card anywhere in the southern part of the state, even if you have a Carbondale, or Mt Vernon card, it is now good for checking any book out there.  You can also access the Online Catalog system, and access your library account, and even place items on order yourself, and the staff will even show you how to do that if you ask them.\n\nI am writing this review upon my final visits, due to, as I will be driving to a different school starting next week, in a different area of the Metro East.  They all knew what I did as a bus driver and was supportive of my being there as well.\n\nSo I have had good experiences overall, and rate the place about a 4, because it is in a building of Historical Significance, the computer access policy, an awesome microfilm (of Belleville News Democrat - Back to 1930s) collection, and a great children's section as well.","date":1382626631000}

Three years ago it was great, including the breakfast.  \n\nBut this last visit, Dec 2016, not too good.  I never got an answer to three phone calls previous to the visit.  (Three different days and three different times of day) So, I emailed to request courtyard view.  My Superior bedroom was facing the courtyard but it did not view the courtyard.  I was put on the third floor which viewed  the top of a tarp that covered the courtyard during inclement weather.  Only the weather was not inclement ... I suppose they were too tired to remove tarp.  They are very busy. (Never got answer to email either)\n\nWe booked the room for two people and had to request two wash clothes each day since there were none.\n\nThe concierge never looked up from her PC to welcome guests and it would look better if she would smile. (She probably wasn't feeling well)\n\nDoorman was great and the desk service was prompt.\n\nThe breakfast was not up to standard for a hotel of this price point.  It seemed cooked hours previously, then placed on steam trays.  Similar to what is served in La Quinta.  Eggs were scrambled and stiff, bacon was limp and chewy and all the breads were stale and cold.  Juice and coffee were fine.  We stayed three days but only ate breakfast there the first.  Even though breakfast cost was included in the room cost.\n\nHint to cooks: If you keep scrambled eggs on steam trays they continue to cook and become over done.  Also breads, bagels and croissants are baked fresh daily in the Quarter.  It would be good to serve it.\n\nOn the better side the rooms were very clean and when the drain in the shower was slow, leaving us standing in an inch of water, they sent maintenance man right away and repaired it.  Slept well every night\n\nI am sorry but we will not be staying a third time and cannot recommend this hotel as a 4 or 5 star hotel.","date":1482164407000}

I made an exception with Something Grilled because I am a huge barbecue fan. This used to be a takeout only place in Honey Brook, and they have moved to Exton and opened their first restaurant. Getting to know a new market, and adapting to new staffing issues takes time. Having eaten takeout from here once, and eaten in once, here are my first impressions...  \n\nMy takeout order was a rack of ribs with three sides and cornbread. The ribs were dry-rubbed and finished with a sweet Memphis style sauce with no \"heat.\" The ribs are baby-back, not regular pork ribs, and for baby-backs were quite meaty and done nicely. They did NOT \"fall off the bone,\" and had just the right amount of \"tooth\" necessary for good ribs. The sides were summer slaw, which was spectacular; competent potato salad, which was potato,milk, butter, and pickle relish style; and mac and cheese, which was suitably creamy and a little stringy with mild white cheddar. The mac and cheese would have benefited from sharp cheddar and a little cayenne; it was pretty bland.\n\nWhen I stopped by for lunch, I ordered the Carolina pulled pork barbecue sandwich with a side of ranch fries well done. Service was swift, but it was well after the lunch rush. I ordered ice tea, which was brewed (a good sign), and was given a basket of corn muffins and honey-cinnamon butter. The fries were well done as requested, and the sandwich was excellent -- stacked high with pulled pork with a light vinegar sauce and topped with summer slaw. The twist is that they bake a slice of mild white cheddar onto the bottom of the top bun. You barely notice it, but it does help hold the slaw onto the sandwich, otherwise a frequent failing with Carolina 'cue. \n\nIt's pretty easy to criticize a new restaurant. This one is worth giving a little time to shake out any difficulties.","date":1386376333000}

Now, however, she has caught up with demand (probably from the Vandy girls) and sells clothes and accessories from all over.  \n\nI did try on a really cute knit halter dress, perfect for a beach cover up or just kicking around in the summer, but it was $50 and as I'm trying to save some money these days, figured I could buy something similar at Old Navy or Target.  Some cute dresses and knit shirts though.  There is also quite a selection of wraps, scarves, and various products from Mexico, South America, Indonesia, and other countries I'm sure.  \n\nAgain, the owner was very friendly and explained the layout of the store, and the sales girls were eager to help without being too pushy.

We ordered Bloody Marys and Mimosas and they were delicious! I especially enjoyed the Bloody Mary. \n\nWe ordered the fried green tomatoes eggs benedict and crab cake eggs benedict. They were both so delicious. The crab cakes were huge and full of delicious crab! The poached egg was perfect, I literally almost licked my plate clean.

Chips are great, but man that salsa lacks any and all flavor. No salt in it, no spice, no heat. The sweet potato and pork nachos were okay. It seems like a place that's overpriced and terrible because it can be due to its location. Up your salsa game. \n\n\n******************UPDATE***********************\n\nSo I went into their location on oak street after a fun night out with my buddy and I told him \"let's just go see if their salsa is any different than the other location. Plus, it was Endymion that night, so who knows. Everyone deserves a second chance.\"\n\nWe sit down at the bar and my buddy goes to use the restroom. Bartender asks me if we're eating, drinking, or a little of both. I told him about my previous salsa experience and he nodded. Thinking nothing of it, I go to use the restroom after my bro comes out and upon my return I have the general manager, the owner (I think?), and a chef all gathered around me to have me try their new salsa! Apparently they recognized me from my yelp profile picture, and wanted to leave a better impression. Well they most certainly did. They did something that I'm not accustomed to seeing in restaurants: they cared. \n\nTo veer off into a tiny tangent for a second, of all the restaurants I go to, good food is usually just a percentage or part of the overall experience. You won't go into an Applebee's or Chili's expecting to be taken care of. You go in there, you lock eyes with your waiter's tired eyes, you know everything is nuked in the microwave, you order it anyways, you eat, you pay, you tip, you leave. Don't expect anything magical from Applebee's or Chili's. They don't care. It's a mechanical process that's specialized by corporate heads in nicer places to delude you into thinking you're getting great service, or at least are entitled to, but you're not. You know that. But that's now why you go there. But that's the difference between those chain restaurants and restaurants that care. So to bring my tangent back to my main point, La Casita definitely left a lasting impression on me by showing how much they care. And that's what you want in a restaurant. \n\nThey changed their salsa and I got to try it. Now to be honest, fair, and balanced I didn't like their new salsa either. But if you're going based off of flavor, it was a thousand times better than what I experienced previously. I've worked at a Mexican restaurant where they made their salsa in house, and my tastebuds can't speak for everyone as everyone has specific things they like and dislike. I just happen to like salsa with a bit more heat, tang, and pop. But their salsa is definitely unique and improved.\n\nHave not had an opportune chance to sit down and dine there yet, but will as soon as I can find some time! If you're in the mood for \"Tex mex meets Southern California with an authentic Mexican twist\" as the bartender described it, then definitely head down there and be greeted by people who want you to enjoy your experience not because they're getting paid to but, rather more importantly, because they care.","date":1489542852000}

Whenever I get ready for a trip, researching ice cream shops is at the top of my to-do list. I don't care if it's the dead of winter. You take coffee breaks? I take ice cream breaks. I realize that I take this obsession\/addiction to an unhealthy extreme, as I've been known to eat it for dinner. \n\nWith that said, you can imagine that I was really excited to try this place since it is so highly rated on yelp. When reading the reviews, I was convinced that Creole Creamery was going to be the \"Bi-rite of the south\" (best ice cream I've ever had). I had some pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, it did not deliver quite like I thought it would but it certainly wasn't bad. \n\nMy main problem is that out of the 3 flavors I had, THEY ALL TASTED IDENTICAL. I got the Basil Coconut & Lavender and my sister got the Rose. These were some of the most unique flavors they offered and you'd think they'd be pretty distinguishable from one another. Alas, neither of us could taste much difference. The flavors were extremely subtle.\n\nWhat I did love however was the creaminess and texture. This is where it gets close to the Bi-Rite status. The ice cream itself is very rich and smooth with perfect consistency. You simply can't buy something like this in the store. Had the flavors wowed me, I would have given this 5 stars, hands down (and it truly would have become the \"Bi-Rite of the South\" in my book).\n\nAll in all, I will definitely go back. I mean, it's still great ice cream. And I'm sure if I tried a more traditional flavor, the taste would be stronger. I just really love the weird stuff :)","date":1438897408000}

In fact, on the day that I finally found my apartment, my parents and I were driving down the road and stumbled upon a building adorned with a big, red, flashing sign-it read, \"Joey B's on the Hill.\" Since we were famished from all of the decision making, we decided to give it a whirl.\n\nNow, Joey B's is not quite located in the same area as the rest of the Hill restaurants, so I was anxious to see what it was like-most of the others are sit down, semi-nice, lit by the light of 1,000 candles types of places. You know, your typical Italian joint--checkered table clothes and all.\n\nJoey B's was a little different as it looked a little more like a sports bar than most other places on the Hill--fewer candles, more big screen TVs. [Of course, my father was extraordinarily pleased that he could watch the Nascar race while we ate, so it was all good.]\n\nAfter looking over the menu, my mom decided to order the French Dip and my dad and I decided to split a pizza-half supreme, half BBQ chicken. That's half sausage, pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, green pepper & onion and half grilled chicken, red onion and provel cheese with BBQ sauce. Let's just be honest. This was a mistake. And the mistake was my fault. I was the one who ordered the BBQ half of the pizza and it just did not hold a candle to the \"regular\" half of the pizza.\n\nYes, I'll admit that for once in my life a pizza with provel cheese on it--impressed me. I didn't expect that! But, the BBQ pizza was too sweet and I'm sad to say that we didn't eat much of it.\n\nLuckily, my dad let me have a little of his and I was so glad he did, because his half of the pizza was much better than mine.\n\nThe pizza had a nice crunchy crust, but it didn't crumble and fall apart like some thin crusts can. Plus, the sauce was really good. Nice and tangy. In fact, I believe that the menu said that this was Rachel Ray's favorite pizza sauce--and who can argue with that?\n\nAll in all, it was just good pizza. No, not the *best* I'd ever had, but good. Plus, it was pretty BIG too-definitely enough to share. So either go in expecting left overs or take a BIG appetite.\n\nNow that we've talked pizza, let's talk about the [unexpected] best part of the meal. My mom's french dip sandwich.\n\nThin, juicy, sliced roast beef served with its own au jus and melted provel cheese on French bread. This sandwich was very moist and very flavorful. I would have to describe it as comfort food... to the point where I am seriously look forward to going there in the winter and having one.\n\nPlus, once again, I'm proud to say that I enjoyed the provel cheese on this dish! *gasp!* Maybe St. Louis is stealing my soul.... Or maybe Joey B's just knows how to use juuuustttt enough provel to bring the flavor palette in without overwhelming the taste buds. Yeah, I'll go with the second option.\n\nOther menu items that we selected included onion rings (very heavily breaded, but pretty good... your standard onion rings) and side salads (again, the provel cheese was good on these salads. Shocking!). It was all just very satisfying; a nice hearty, savory meal.\n\nSo, what's the final judgement? The food was good (and partially changed my mind about provel cheese), the service friendly, and the atmosphere upbeat but not super exciting. I'd have to grade Joey B's like this:\n\nFood: A-\nAtmosphere: B\nService: A\nPrice: $\nPortion Size: Large\n\nIt truly seemed like a great place to grab a pizza and a couple beers and hang out with your friends.

They stuff these boats to the brim and it's a total tourist trap. The water is brown and there is little to see. Much better off doing a swamp tour so you can at least see alligators and birds.  The one positive is they don't charge an arm and a leg for cold drinks which are an absolute must on this tour if you must go. So many other fun things to enjoy, I'd skip this one if I were you.","date":1502142694000}

The design is much more open and more conducive to bringing people to and through the center core.\n\nNow that Locale Market has opened for business I expect the flow of people day and night will definitely increase. More traffic means more vitality.\n\nThree restaurants on the second floor will be opening in 2015. Farm Table Kitchen which is the upstairs dining component to Locale Market. Ruth's Chris Steak House will bring a nationally known brand to the mix and Sea Salt, which is expanding from its original location in Naples, Florida, should bring additional attention and spark to Sundial's dining options.\n\nBut the retail mix to date just does not do much for me because I can either find the same shops elsewhere - Tommy Bahama, Chico's and Lululemon athletic clothing - or the new-to-the-market or locally owned shops are limited in what they offer.\n\nThis is a lovely complex in the center of a lively downtown that should become a destination for food but also for other reasons that encourage spending time and spending money.

My Southern and Texas friends swear it is the best ice cream on the earth. When someone says, \"Best on the earth,\" that is like throwing down the ice scoop to a challenge. \n\nThe Blue Bell is located in the front of the store. It's on the backside of the huge glass display case for the truffles, caramel apples and specialty chocolates. When I went, I was expecting maybe six or so flavors being offered on a rotating schedule. To my surprise, there were over two dozen flavors to choose from. For a brief moment I felt like a kid in a candy shop. Oh wait, I was in a candy shop, that had an ice cream parlor too. \n\nThe young lady working the counter was very patient with me, as I was having a hard time selecting my first Blue Bell flavor. I finally went with, Birthday Cake. It was a rich creamy vanilla with pieces of chocolate cake and swirls of chocolate icing and bright colored sprinkles. I'm sure you have heard, sprinkles are for winners. After enjoying my Blue Bell, I now understand not only the love the South has for this ice cream, but why the South has an obesity problem. This ice cream is too good to resist. \n\nNow, I'll talk about the RSC. This store was amazing, I had no idea they had so much to offer. They had pre-boxed, by the piece, Jelly Belly jelly beans, Weight Watchers candy and some the most decadent caramel apples. This is a great place for picking up a gift for that special Aunt, Grandma or person that stumps you every time on what to get them. \n\nPersonally I prefer local chocolates, Kakao and Bissinger's, but for gifts and Blue Bell, I will keep this candy store on my shopping list.","date":1426702703000}

That needs to change.   However, from time to time, you find a spot that allows you to feel like you are on a mini vacation.   Revolucion is that type of place.   Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I had this on my \"wish list\" for a good while and on a \"date night\" with my better half, we received a \"day pass\" out of the suburbs for a night to visit Fountain Square.   \nWalking in to the main bar area in the front, you get a sense that a great deal of time and effort was put into getting the decor just right.  \nBut then, the special treat.  Walking through what has a feel of a magical portal to vacation-land (for grownups), you enter the Tiki Bar area and instant relaxation.   I must say that the service was excellent and our bartender was fun and made us feel at home.   \nThe menu is straightforward, with a nice variety of appetizers (pinchos), tacos and burgers.   No fuss, no muss.  Being on the veggie side of the street, I ordered and enjoyed the Taco de Papas - which is two tacos with roasted potatoes, poblanos, corn and queso fresco and crema.   Just right.   \nWe would highly recommend Revolucion for both the service and the food.   Another special gem in an outstanding neighborhood!","date":1372089095000}

Plus, it's a convenient location (for me).\n\nIf you are in a hurry, you might want to call ahead and place an order to-go. It's a small space with limited seating, particularly at lunch.

I'd cut the woman some slack if I saw a doctor's note certifying that she was really mute, but she wasn't sharing.  Her response to us ordering was sighing and rolling her eyes.  WTF?  The good thing was,  I was not here to make friends.  I came here with one purpose in life - to slay a mighty roast beef n gravy Po Boy.  It was just what I wanted and more.  So good.  Sweet potato fries are bomb, too.  Good selection of Abita.  Hush puppies were whatever.  Kinda tasteless and underwhelming.  Bread pudding was amazing.

The clientele mostly consists of people who like to take their transport of choice and drive it around with people who have similar transports of choice as they (READ: bikers and people with cool, classic cars). The place itself is split into two structures: the tavern and the restaurant. \n\nWe were there for lunch, so we got to sit in the room with the big window and HUGE fireplace. The menu is fairly small but offers a nice selection, and I went for their standard, famous chili (I dare not try their \"fancy\" chili with black beans and wild game including rabbit...I don't eat the bunnies :C ), and I decided to have it atop a plate of fries. Very very yummy. I had a lavender martini to go with it, which was made with  fresh lavender picked from the outside! That was okay. The winner, however, was The Smuggler, a spirited dessert coffee drink made with creme de menthe (or peppermint schnapps?). Now I'm a HUGE mint fiend, and I already expected it wouldn't be minty enough for me, but surprisingly perfectly minty! \n\nThe prices of everything isn't a great deal, but it's still pretty fair.\n\nI took a peek into the actual tavern, which was pretty cool looking. I'd gladly have a drink in there, or outside the place, as you can do and would want to do on a nice day as it was when I went, but by no means am I going to have a hankerin' to drive allll the way over there just to have a few cold ones.

So, when we had guests in town, we decided to drive a bit and take them to Bottleworks on a nice fall day to enjoy a few drinks before dinner at our place. What in the heck happened to this place? Saturday afternoon, the patio was about 2\/3 full, but we got a 30-45 minute wait for 15 people including a few babes. On top of that, we were told we had to order food if we sat on the patio. Fine, we will order a few appetizers. Nope, it had to be entrees. After promising to make it up to the server and tip well, we were given a pager. Waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty. Once seated, some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad, so that made the meal I already had prepared completely worthless. The topper was when we got our checks, the server told us we were not as bad as she expected and to come back again when we got babysitters for the babies. So is there some new trend in hospitality to treat your guests like this that should make them want more? \nI do hold a special place in my heart for this place as we used to walk there with our kids all the time and even hit up their markets and other events, but I was so embarrassed for talking this place up the way I did and actually driving more than a mile to go here.

Anyway, the waiter came by, opened the wine and told us about the specials. I guess its picky if you want the wine opened and then given a few minutes to relax before hearing the specials. Anyway, another man came by several minutes later and asked if we were told the specials. We asked for a few minutes and he was very nice and said sure no problem. I will get to the food, but you have to read what else took place to understand why they need someone to co-ordinate the staff. A waitress brought the appetizers and when we were almost done, yet another waitress brought us bread with dipping sauce. Been nice to get the bread first. The dinner was brought out by a different waitress. At the end of the meal the a waitress brought by the dessert cart , which we passed on. The original waiter stopped by to ask about dessert, I said no thanks, but we would like the check. In between we kept trying to get someone's attention because we had asked to take part of an entree home. The waiter was way to busy and basically blew us off, one of the waitress' also passed by, but we couldn't get her to stop. Finally the man that seemed to be the manager came by and he took care of it.\nOk, that's the bad news and maybe they were shorthanded , but a lot of other Yelpers note the same problem with service issues. People shouldn't have to sit and wait 15-30 minutes for a table. If this wasn't BYO, then you could always go sit at a bar and have a drink. The other thing is, no one offered to open the wine while we were waiting,as many BYO's will do if they can't seat you on time. Nor, did anyone say sorry about the wait.\nThe food was very good, even as picky as I am. The shrimp tempura was serving of 5 very large gulf shrimp atop a very flavorful asain slaw. The duo, which consists of a crabcake slider and a sirloin slider was great. The crabcake was moist and had ample pieces of lump crabmeat. The sirloin slider was excellent, could of eaten a lot of those. The entree's were also top notch. The special Grouper with beans and crab was moist, cooked perfectly and had a nice red pepper sauce on the bottom.\nAs most of the reviews talk about here, the Lobster ravioli is as good as anywhere in this area. The pasta was light, the ravioli was stuffed with lobster meat and the sauce was great.\nLike I said, take care of the service and seating issues and this is a 4 star. They do have their own lot, but you probably will have to park across the street if it's a weened night. I was glad I put this address in the nav system because at night and the first time there it's a little hard to find.\nWill give them another try in hopes the service improves.","date":1359309156000}

The food is really good and very authentic Mexican. Before taking your order they bring you chips and salsa. The chips are authentic themselves, which means they're not all salty as you would expect American chips to be. But you don't need them salty when there's salsa, plus they bring you limes which are an excellent addition if you squeeze them over the chips. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful but not in your face as at some restaurants. The building is nice, and it's a really pleasant atmosphere. Plus the food doesn't take very long to come.\n\nIt's definitely not a fancy restaurant, so if you're looking for someplace for a special occasion you might want to look elsewhere.

We dined here last night, and were very happy. The ambiance and interior design are top notch. It's very impressive how the space has been transformed from the previous tenant. The food was outstanding, which is unsurprising considering the chef's pedigree. We had two lovely cocktails and a whole fish that was perfectly cooked along with a terrific short rib play on stroganoff. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that those cocktails and two entrees ended up costing $140. The Love is really good, but it's also surprisingly expensive. Entrees are priced in the $30-$40 range and appetizers and pastas are not far behind. The Love bills itself as a neighborhood restaurant, and it would be, perhaps, the platonic ideal of that if the prices dropped by a third. As is, it's as expensive as any non-tasting menu restaurant in Philly. Is that worth it when you can eat for less up the block at Vernick, etc? I'm not totally sure.

You tuck and fold the middle to eat.  I mean, it's delicious, but I feel I shovel too much in that way and lose the individual taste of the fabulous toppings. The outside crust was  puffy and tender.\n\nNice bartender service and he was really runnng around. I think it was a surprisingly busy day downtown. The gelato is always amazing. I'm in a rut. I always get the Thai coconut and something chocolate or coffee. Some day I will have had my fill of coconut and try other flavors. No I won't!","date":1487509569000}

She is a fantastically knowledgable instructor with a keen eye and deep knowledge of body mechanics. She worked with me to develop proper alignment, core strength and flexibility. Over the past two years, I've gotten strong, my posture is better, my stamina has improved significantly. And, my core, leg and arm strength have made me much more resilient - I've even started running again (haven't done that for years). Over the two years at Springtime, I've expanded my fitness regime to include training on Red Cord with Peter Madden, and on Gyro with Joyce Chen. This is all in addition to the still challenging Pilates work outs with Lisa.  It's great to be able to engage in a dynamic fitness program that constantly challenges and evolves to keep me growing and improving.

Gooey cheese and salty ham between a donut covered in powdered sugar with a hefty dollop of raspbery preserves nestled in the center of the donut. This was a magical creation. Get it if you have the chance.\n\nFinally, to top of my donut extravaganza, I chose the Miso Olive Oil Praline Bacon donut. It's a mouthful to say but wasn't to consume.

I like eating cake with frosting.  I don't want to eat too much of cake without frosting. \nSecond, I'm not a fan of having chocolate chips in my red velvet cake.  They overwhelm the flavor of cream cheese frosting. \nThird, and this is the biggest negative, the frosting does not melt in the mouth!  It's too thick and hard, which means when you eat the cake with the frosting, they do not mash well in the mouth to give the goodness of all the flavors melted together. You might as well eat them separately. \n\nI only tried their red velvet cupcake, and maybe their other flavors are better, but I think I make better cupcakes at home, and I have certainly had much better cupcakes from other stores.

I usually stay in Center City but all the hotels in the area were sold out because of the Equality Forum. I scored a decent rate of $120\/night + tax through Expedia.\n\nIn any event, I enjoyed the overall vibe of the place. I checked in around 2:30pm. I was greeted by the handsome, energetic front desk clerk and directed to room 225.\n\nWhile room 225 was definitely one of the larger rooms in the hotel, there's a reason for that. It was a double room designed for someone who uses a wheelchair. I was only staying one night so I didn't bother making a big fuss about it, but I did enjoy the larger size. Some of the accessibility \"extras\", like everything being REALLY low for easier access, took some getting used to. The bathroom area was equally huge, with easy access to the sink and closet area, as well as a water closet and roll-in shower tucked behind a huge sliding door. The shower itself had one of those detachable shower heads as well as a gym-shower style dispenser with body wash and shampoo. \n\nAs for the bed, other than being ridiculously low to the floor (again, for easier access for those in wheelchairs), it was pretty comfortable and I slept pretty soundly. The TV had a decent selection of HDTV channels. Complementary water and coffee was in the room, as well as a mini-fridge in the bathroom area in case you wanted to keep drinks or meds cool. \n\nThe parking fee was $9 with in\/out privileges. You had to get a new ticket every time you entered and the front desk would stamp it when you wanted to leave the lot. The lot is pretty large and shared with two other Sheraton properties (They also run a shared shuttle in case you're going to or from the airport.).  \n\nI took a quick look at the pool area. It was pretty empty but again, it's early May and that's to be expected, I guess. There's not much choices for food onsite, other than a quick-service area that's a tad overpriced (again, to be expected). You can drive north maybe 5 minutes on Island Avenue for fast food if you needed to. The bar area looked fun, but again, it was pretty empty for a Saturday.\n\nAll in all, if I had to stay outside of Center City Philadelphia again, I'd probably stay here. They really should put one of these in Center City, if you ask me. It'd be perfect.","date":1367939518000}

We opted to run downstairs from the hotel, cause the menu was bigger than room service. We ordered two soups, two salads, a dessert.....we got two salads, one soup, no utensils.

A friend was in town and after a day at Busch Gardens we were starved.  I remembered seeing Tsunami when  I was at the nearby Home Depot and the place looked appealing.  I checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  For a Holiday weekend it was crowded, but it didn't take too long to get seated at a Hibachi table.  I have been a huge Benihana fan in the past and enjoy this style of restaurant.  I noticed there were a lot of drinks specials on the menu and the pricing seemed very reasonable compared to Benihana.  There was one guest at the table who had a lot of questions and special requests which took some time to get sorted out, but once she was accommodated, the service moved more quickly.  Not the servers fault.  The portions were huge!  I also didn't expect to get noodles in addition to rice, but it made for some quality left overs the next day.  I ordered the shrimp, scallop and filet teppanyaki and like I stated prior the portions were generous, the fried rice was ok, just rice and egg, no veggies or proteins mixed in - pretty basic, but it was well seasoned.  I was impressed with the scallops and the shrimp and quality of the filet.  All was cooked properly, and the chef was entertaining and efficient.  While the reviews for Tsunami were mixed on Yelp, I would not hesitate to come back and bring friends.  It was an enjoyable experience and a good value.","date":1473123475000}

The first time was great. Bar was busy, but we snagged a spot to stand and got great service. Between the delicious cocktails (peanut infusion is a real treat), the upbeat music, and friendly patrons and staff, we thought we had found our spot for the rest of our trip.\n\nThe second time was much different. Although the bar was pretty empty, the two bartenders ignored us after our first drink order, chatting up and serving other patrons, but letting our drinks sit empty for over 15 minutes, despite our efforts to catch their eye. It appeared they'd determined middle-aged patrons were a better source of tips and saved their charm for them. When one server finally checked in with us (asking abruptly if we were okay, not suggesting another cocktail or anything to make us feel welcome), our mood had been soured and so we passed on the second drink we'd been planning and moved on to Batch up the street, where the cocktails are just as good and the bartender was happy to serve them.\n\nSad to offer a less than hearty recommendation because our first trip here was so great.

And don't think you can go and order something (like the waffle) without the bacon because your requests for revisions will be \"politely declined\" as it states on the menu.   I like that they tell you ahead of time but it doesn't seem like it would be a terrible thing to request that the cook doesn't sprinkle the bacon on top of the waffle. \n\nThey do have some very interesting drinks and I would consider going there to grab a coffee because the process for coffee seemed to be quite intricate.  \n\nI will say that the their menu has changed since they opened and a lot of what was mentioned in previous reviews is no longer on the menu.","date":1414417727000}

First impression walking in the door, smoke-free (yay!) and beautiful original brickwork, but a really scrubbed-clean feeling.  Which is good, or could be.  Maybe it just felt out of place in Soulard :).  \n\nFrom there it was all downhill.  The menus we were given were dog-eared, ripped, with pen marks and spots of indeterminable provenance.  Poor impression.  Print some new menus.  \n\nWe were not offered a drink list.  When I asked for the drink list, the server said, \"We don't have a drink list, but I can get you a wine menu.\"  But there is a neon Bud Light sign in the window.  If you don't have a list printed, use your voice and tell me what you offer.  A note on the wine menu: sorted into reds and whites.  Fair enough.  Beneath the reds?  The whites.  And beneath the whites?  The reds.  Print some new menus.  And considering the venue, their wine pricing is high.  The server made no effort to sell us drinks.  \n\nThe food.  The first thing the server told us was that they were out of the soup of the day.  Ok, fine, benefit of the doubt, it must have been excellent and super-popular, right?  We started with hummus - not my choice.  Did not meet expectations.  I ordered meatloaf.  It was surprisingly dense and rather dry - full of filler.  The mashed potatoes looked more like mashed hash browns, I don't quite know how to describe them.  The green beans had to have come from a freezer bag.  And the fried onion & jalapeno straws were completely out of place on the plate.  I probably left half of my food behind; I could have done better at home.  \n\nOne of my friends ordered a wrap he seemed to enjoy, the other ordered the special - they serve prime rib Saturday evenings.  She found it under-done but it looked right to me.  For some reason we thought we might need an order of the mac and cheese.  Friends, if your mother ever made you mac and cheese, this will be a disappointment.  \n\nMy glass of wine was empty for, I don't know, a good half an hour.  The server never noticed.  \n\nThe facilities in the handicap bathroom I realize must have been built to code but anyone paying attention will notice that the soap dispenser, mirror, and towel dispenser are unsuitably high for someone sitting in a wheelchair.  \n\nI wish Market Grill all the best; someone has put a lot of love into the building and is trying to make it as an entrepreneur, and I appreciate that.

In short,  if you are looking for decent (sometimes very good) food, great margaritas,  and a very good bartender,  this might be your spot. Zero in on one or two menu items and enjoy the drinks and company.","date":1435959139000}

This \"business man\" is not who or what he claims to be. He is not nice, professional, or reliable. I am baffled at this man's success within the local community; all things come to the light eventually. \n\nMy personal headache with this I met the \"proprietor\" out last summer, he was a nice enough guy, we had a bunch of mutual acquaintances. When he told me what he did, as shoe junkie I was happy to support a young local business as I too have a young local business, and strongly believe in supporting young entrepreneurs and craftsmen. \n\nFast forward to January, when I called to have my shoes picked up, as Patinas had transitioned into a mobile service. Alexander came to my house at 8am to pick up my shoes that needed repair; five pairs (4 heels, one pair of flats). He requested I pay upfront, being that it was early in the morning, we had numerous mutual contacts, and he is a young business with hesitation agreed. Thankfully I wrote a check tragically it was for nearly $250. What I was told I was buying was a six pair sole and heel package, the remaining pair I could call in at any time. A receipt would be emailed to me, and my shoes would be done in 10-14 days.\n10 days later I call to inquire about my shoes, they are not ready. Day 14, I get voicemail. Day 20 I get hung up on. This persisted. I sent emails, Facebook messages, texts. I get no response. \n\nEventually I get a weird and vague communication from Alexander's \"assistant\". Nothing is resolved, and then I am blocked from any means of contacting the business and its owner. \n\nIn March 3 months later I run into Alexander, we have a hostile and rude exchange. He proceeded to call me a peon and other nasty names, denying having my shoes. In April I see this individual at another event, he laughs as I walk away knowing good and well what is up. Literally as I am prepping to sue this questionable character calls, yep I was that upset he calls and claims there was a mix up, he indeed has my shoes and will drop them off later that day. I give him my work address via a text and email. No response. \n\nHe shows up the next morning, doesn't say a word and shows me the 4 heels he has repaired. The work is not bad, I have had much better work done elsewhere without the drama. I inquire about my gold flats, give a description and am told he would look for them, No apology, no explanation given, nothing. \n\nI get an email asking for the shoes to be described, which I find odd considering that I just did this, and that I would get an apology letter later in the day. In my response I suggest a refund, my other shoes found\/returned or replaced, only to be answered with \"I never had your flats, and a link to his website. No apology, no receipt. \n\nFunny, he doesn't have my flats like he didn't have my shoes, like he did not remember who I was in March before he decided I was all these terrible random things, and cursed me out. \n\nThe lies, deception and utter disregard for customer service and human decency is too much.  I responded professionally requesting a refund, shoes replacement, receipt, and apology. I got zero response. \n\nThis whole exchange was really frustrating, and unprofessional. At this point I am out a pair of flats, it's not the end of the world but it is disappointing. It's unfortunate that someone feels entitled to treat others in this fashion, to deceive and steal.\n\nWhile I am elated that I have my heels back, the reality the work Bourne did was mediocre and his customer service is HORRIBLE! I will chalk this up as a lesson to be careful who I choose to do business with. Research everyone, and do not use Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for ANY  service. You will be disappointed, ripped off and or treated poorly. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble.","date":1402506894000}

Michelle, I think that's her name it's on my receipt but she never introduced herself, was the rudest person I have ever given my money to in my life. When we sat down she was talking about personal issues with the barback loud enough for us to hear and I thought that was odd in and off itself. When she gave us our menus she said a few times \"these menus are good for the next 30 seconds.\"  Sorry but either give us brunch or give us dinner menus and explain that the kitchen is in the midst of a shift change, don't make us feel pressured because you dropped menus that have an extremely short time limit. Instead of eating we decided to just get drinks. She let us know that the brunch menu libations were, her words, 2 for 1. We ordered a mimosa off the list and hung out. When we got get drinks they set two wooden tokens down but didn't reference the at all, so we didn't know what they were for.  Eventually ordered some food off the dinner menu to go. She was very non existent the whole time we were sitting at the bar, not attentive at all. When we asked for the bill I saw that both our drinks were on there. I asked about them and let her know about the 2 for 1 statement she said. She then proceeded to tell me it was buy one, get one and that's what the tokens are for. I told her that \"buy one get one\" and \"2 for 1\" are different and if we knew it was BOGO we would have ordered another drink (if she would have even paid attention to us).  After a little back and forth she said she would take care of it and that \"they weren't trying to screw us.\"  She talked to us like we were the worst people on earth because she doesn't know how to explain her own restaurants policies. I work in an industry that has me visiting 10-15 bars\/restaurants\/hotels a day and I have never had a worse hospitality experience in my life. Tavern Management - this employee is losing you revenue left and right.  Not only is she not taking care of customers and grabbing reorders, she is turning people away for good. This treatment was so horrible and off putting that I am going to go out of my way to recommended against going to Tavern due to the disrespect we felt.

This is my go-to place when I want to indulge in a truly fabulous facial.  For the reasonable-ish price of $90, the hour-long Classic Rescue Facial leaves you fresh and revitalized -\nand your skin feels like a baby's bottom (that is clean, of course).\n\nI've gone to Rescue for a couple years now, and I've had a few deep tissue\/swedish massages (no complaints!) but mostly facials.  \n\nThe 2nd floor space  (the building is at 17th and Latimer, go in the lobby, take the elevator one floor up) is open, clean, bright, spacious and modern with dark wooden floors.  It feels, smells and looks like a spa. My five senses give Rescue thumbs-up!\n\nThe treatment rooms themselves are really nice and roomy and lit just right. Some rooms have pretty chandeliers or have small candles.  Sheets, robes and all the accoutrements are clean and soft.\n\nStaff are polite, casual and down to earth.  If they're not busy or booked back to back, they'll offer you some delicious what-have-you infused water or beverage of your choosing.\n\nI hear their makeup artist on staff is really good - and I've seen her do her thing on occasion (she works on her clientele right there in the open -so you get to watch)\n\nFew drawbacks, never had a mani\/pedi here, so I can't attest to the quality or whether they're worth it, but word to the wise, like other reviews have mentioned, there are no pedi chairs - just basically a wooden bench with some loose pillows - which doesn't strike me as relaxing or remotely comfortable. \n\nAlso, the changing rooms are basically non-existent. One for women and one for men - which leaves you with no privacy if you want to change and shower at your leisure.  There's nothing calming about waiting for the change room to free up or rushing to change or shower so someone else can get in. (what is this, a YMCA?)  On busy weekends, the waiting areas tend to fill up too - so it can get a little 'packed'.\n\nLastly, some of the esthesticians have a tendency to really push their products - which I hate and find annoying especially when I'm already spending good money getting a treatment - - so buyer beware, as the line of products they carry are pretty expensive.\n\nBut cons, aside, I'll still go back to Rescue and look forward to trying out other treatments.","date":1236113778000}

We were here well over an hour. The time between getting our drinks, taking our order, and getting our food was pretty long. Even getting our check took forever but our server was very friendly. It was a good thing we weren't in a hurry. \n\nMy husband and I ordered build your own burgers with tater tots. Menu stated two patties with your choice of cheese and condiments. I thought that has to be huge but I didn't see a single patty option. When the burger arrived I realized why it was two patties. They were thin. Mine were very crisp as in overcooked but at least they were warm. My husband's were cold. The tots were ok. The burger was edible but not great which was disappointing considering burger is in the name.","date":1523797854000}

On my second visit, the employee admitted he didn't know how to make all of the menu options; he could definitely use better training. I received a smoothie that likely had all of the listed ingredients, but the proportions of those ingredients were way off. My smoothie only tasted like lemon and celery. It was too sour to finish.

They prefer if you start out with an appetizer or something, because the sushi is made to order, and depending on how busy it is (every table was occupied at noon today), you'll have a bit of a wait for it. The lunch was $9.99 per person. I don't know how you can possibly beat that! I did not care for the ginger dressing on my salad. It tasted quite bitter to me. I also didn't really care for my tempura banana. It was more of a texture thing for me. Once a banana gets heated up, it gets very mushy. Everything else was delicious.

It all changed quickly as we walked into the \"Tennessee Fill Station\" (or some name similar) portion of the building. The fellas working there directed us to the \"Tennessee Tap Room\" (or some name similar) portion of the building that overlooked 2 stories into the \"Tennessee Brew Works\" (or some name similar) portion of the building where the brewing takes place. I've added the specifics because this is the first group audacious and clever enough to pull off all three portions under one roof.... and to still comply with Tennessee's archaic liquor laws! If sticking it to the man isn't enough reason for you to check it out.... keep reading. \n\nThe tap room is super neat and cleverly laid out with patios, long & community-oriented tables, a flying bridge or \"catwalk\" and a steady stream of live, local music. It's largely non-smoking (which is enough to convince me to cross the bridge from East Nashville) and has a few TVs to cater to the football crowds. \n\nBiggest fortes:\n\n- The staff is amazing. The smiles and enthusiasm when they start talking about their beer are a sweet relief. They're excited! They're adventurous! They aren't pretentious. Real People.\n- The beers are fresh & different. They keep it local. They aren't afraid to venture from the norm. They add their own zing and flair.... and for that, I respect them.\n- They appreciate the food & beer pairing concept.

We were visiting Nashville and an internet search for restaurants showed this was one of the places to go to in Nashville.  We went for brunch.  I had a good feeling when we first when in and Zeppelins Over the Hills and Far Away was playing but that was probably the most memorable thing.  We didn't start off with the whippped feta, which seems to be the big thing there, maybe that's why we didn't have the same experience as other people.  I ordered the French toast cinnabon thing which was fine.  My wife however, had the Shakshuka and did not like it at all.  Too spicy in the morning, and as someone mentioned in another review, it would have been nice if that was mentioned (although it does say spicy on the menu, I think she was expecting a different spice).  Also, the poached egg to me was disgusting.  My wife used a spoon but could have drank it with a straw.  I think there were two, I give her credit for forcing down one, I couldn't have done it.  We also ordered a bloody mary  and a mimosa.  There wasn't much mimosa as far as volume goes and my bloody mary was a little thick, I think because of olive juice.  We each had side orders of bacon, two slices each at $5, and not like it was super thick.  Overall, the bill was about $80 and my wife was still hungry.  The waitress did notice that my wife hardly ate anything and mentioned getting the whipped feta saying it would help her stomach which was now hurting because of the spice.  She said no, but it would have been nice if the waitress had brought over a sample.  Anyway, like I said, about $80; $10 each for the mimosa and bloody mary, $14 for the three cinnabon french toast, $13 for the Shakshuka, $10 for four slices of bacon and whatever it was for the coffee (which was good).  I'm counting the tip so the coffee must have been up there too as well as the extra pita my wife asked for.  Listen, The Olive Tree Cafe in the Village in NYC has been there forever.  Check out their menu online and check out their prices.  They don't do breakfast, but if you're ever in NYC and get a chance to go there, do it.  It's fun, they have Charlie Chaplin movies playing, tables made of chalkboard to write on and great Middle Eastern food and great prices.

This was our first experience. I feel the admission prices were fair ($24.95pp with AAA card). We spent 5 hours there so it was about $5\/hr per person! We purchased a small locker that was large enough for my large purse, diaper bag, towels and our shoes. The place smelled strongly of chlorine, but it's an indoor water park...that's what it should smell like. The lines were moderately long, but it was a weekend and we knew what we were getting into when we planned the trip. The water temperatures and indoor temperatures were comfortable. The only thing I did not like was the mat that is in the food court area...it sort of hurts your feet if you are barefoot. We did not like waiting in a line to order food and then waiting in another line outside to pick it up, but we tolerated it. i don;t know why people are saying there are no tables and no shade....we sat at a table with shade and we ended up having to move because it was too shady. We purchased the bucket of chicken fingers and french fries for $30. There were way to many french fries and we had to walk the bucket to the car to keep it stored. If we put it in the locker, everything would've smelled like grease. The bucket should also be priced at $25 being that it is mostly french fries...or it should include fresh fruit\/cookies. There is a wave pool as well and I don't know why someone said there isn't. We spent a lot of time in the wave pool as my kids loved it. There were lifeguards everywhere so safety wasn't an issue.

My experience was not a positive one. Let me first say that my friends are now mad at me for bringing them here. I thought it would be hard to go wrong with a 5-star reviewed restaurant, but I was completely mistaken.\n\nNow, the few positives: the jerk chicken was tasty, and the johnny cakes moreso. The staff was courteous. That's it.\n\nThe staff. We got in at 8, and they came for the drink order at 8:25. We ordered our food at the same time, because we didn't know when we'd see them again. Twice in the next half hour, they came by twice to confirm our orders. Some mix-up. We noticed this happening at other tables around us as well. (Some of) the food arrived at 9:30. We waited for more than an hour for our meals! And two of our side orders were forgotten. Was the restaurant unusually busy? Only 60% of the tables were occupied. The other problem with the servers is that, like the menu, they didn't make clear what came with the meals. If somebody is ordering something that already comes with the meal, the staff would think to tell them, right? No. And if you order a beverage, expect it to be about 80% ice. My friends finished theirs in a few sips. So we had to ask for more beverages, and the staff did not bring any. Finally one friend had to go to their car to get some water. A good 20 minutes later I was able to flag them down, and we finally got more to drink. Everyone was cordial, but ignored us for most of the night. The word amateurish comes to mind.\n\nThe ambience? Well, the dining room is nicely decorated, but too cramped. The gentleman at the table behind me kept ramming into my chair. There was just no room. It also would have been nice if they weren't showing The Walking Dead on the big screen TV in front of me. I don't really want to see stabbings and blood spurting while I'm eating. The biggest problem with the setting, though, was the music. A never-ending procession of smooth jazz played at an uncomfortably high volume. I want to know, who actually enjoys that music? My friend said it felt like being trapped in a dentist's waiting room.\n\nThe food. My friend who ordered beef patties said that they were lousy. And we all agreed that the rice and peas were completely flavorless. It came in a 'bowl' the size of a tea cup. As I mentioned, the jerk chicken was tasty, but the portion laughably small. The large portion meal at Yah Mon is significantly smaller than the regular portion at Jerk Hut. I understand that it's organic, but when you order the large portion, you shouldn't go home hungry. And that's exactly what I did. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because some of the minuscule portions of food were tasty.\n\nObviously, none of us are going back, and I couldn't recommend Yah Mon to anyone with whom I wanted to stay friends.","date":1451886835000}

When presenting us with the check, they added a 20% tip to the final total.  We immediately addressed it with the manager - firstly, a check should never be presented with gratuity added unless it's a party of 6 or more.  Secondly, automatically adding 20% is just rude.  Fact of the matter is, we probably would have tipped 20%.  The managers response was weak.  He informed us that many \"Europeans\" don't know the tipping ettiquette and therefore, they decided to assist us by 'adding 20%\" to the check.

When did Chili's get much better?  I haven't been in a Chili's in years and begrudgingly went to dinner here.  I was surprised to see a nice, modern looking restaurant.  All of the tchotchkes hanging from the wall\/ceiling (ala Cracker Barrell) I'm used to seeing at Chili's were gone and the place looked really nice.  They had a special that we happily took advantage of.  For $20 two people can split an appetizer (hello bottomless chips and salsa!) and then each get a full-sized entree.  That is one good deal and the food wasn't half bad either!  The most impressive thing to me were the touchscreen units that were present on each table.  It's so annoying when you are done with your meal and want to leave but can't because you either haven't gotten the bill or the server hasn't come back with your credit card.  When we were ready to go I was able to swipe my credit card in the unit, select a tip amount, and get a printed receipt.  It couldn't have been faster or more efficient.  The touchscreens also can serve as a distraction for your children.  For a buck you can let them play Peggle, Bejeweled, etc.  Sure you could argue that you could just buy those games on your phone for a dollar, but your phone isn't tied up while the kids are playing.

It doesn't overwhelm you with the TeeVees like a lot of sports bars (there's just one giant screen behind the bar). The atmosphere is cozy but there's still decent seating, the staff is friendly and the menu is even a little out there for pub food--gouda melted over apples on ciabatta? Hmm.... I had an apple, candied walnut and feta salad. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's called \"salad\"--it was more like dessert. They could lay off the candied walnuts and raspberry dressing a bit and this would be a lot better and healthier option. I tried my companion's pesto and mushroom sandwich and it was quite good (probably not healthy either). The thick spicy chips were yummy (possibly homemade?). I guess most people don't go to bars to get healthful food, but I sometimes like to mitigate the beer calories by choosing the less fatty-sounding pub fare. I think Old Point may be a better option for those situations.\n\nAnd, regarding beer.... I drank London Pride, which was decent. I'm not really wowed by places that have Boddington's and Fat Tire on tap--these are mass-produced and -distributed beer, people! That said, it's better than Bud or Coors. \n\nOverall, Chatham is a decent bar. I can see why some might be more smitten than I was--it manages to offer a bit more than your generic pub experience and that can go a long way in Indy. If you're a football (soccer) fan you might also give this place extra points. But for me there wasn't really anything special to grab on to.","date":1262967963000}

I have never has Morocan food more delicious than this. \n\nOne bad thing is that it is cash only... which sucks but like i said the food is so great its worth it.","date":1344998493000}

The first day I went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away.  The food came out fast for how many people were there.  However, it lacked any real flavor.  Camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend.  The seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland.  Still hungry, we got the ceviche.  This was the ONLY good thing about our meal.  Water glasses weren't filled at all during the meal, even after the restaurant emptied.\n\nI decided to go back a few days later, to give it another chance.  We had a different server this time, who seemed very new to the business.  Tables who sat after us had their order taken before.  However, again, the food came out fast.  (Wrong order first, but quickly fixed.)  This time I got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish.  Again, VERY disappointed.  Salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings.  The shrimp had NO flavour, they were very much overcooked.  The sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated.  The veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas.  There is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals.\n\nI will not be going back.

No BS...he answered all my questions in a straight-forward honest manner. I was under the mistaken impression that there was an Antenna in the front windshield which Hector correctly told me there wasn't.

Other companies in town did not respond to this question...seriously, the top rated guy on Yelp, quit answering my emails when I asked him who manufactured the glass he used...REALLY? Now, the kicker is Tony's price was the lowest of all 4 I contacted. And, not just a few dollars...he charged $125 including taxes...I had no idea you could get a front windshield replaced for that.

I had the worst experience here. I felt discriminated against, disrespected, and attacked. The place was over crowded because they over sold tickets. We were asked to move from where we were standing because it would block the dancers from walking by. However, they brought out chairs from the back for other people to sit in that same exact spot. The second time we were asked to move because a couple wanted to sit behind us and couldn't see. A woman then turned a chair around and told one of my friends that the seat wasn't for her in a very rude tone. Next, two girls came in and stood directly in front of me which was also directly in front of the doorway where the dancers were supposed to enter, a server came to us and asked us to move again but said nothing to the two girls. We stated that we could not move where he wanted because then we would be blocking the view of the customers already standing there so he then asked us to move to the back of the bar where we would not be able to see anything. After that the rude woman (who told my friend the seat wasn't for her) had her husband tap my friend and ask could she switch places with me because she was too tall and blocking everyone's view. There was no room for us to switch spots so I said no and continued to try to watch the \"show.\" \nHe then tapped her again and asked did she want to sit down, she said no she was fine. He proceeded by pushing the chair into the back of her legs and forcing her to sit down. There was no staff around to assist us with these issues and there was hardly any room to try to find someone so we left before things got anymore out of hand. As we stood outside getting ready to leave a couple that lived next door overheard us talking about how disrespected we felt they chimed in and said that many of the people there are impolite and rude. I will never again in my life recommend nor visit this establishment.","date":1457384878000}

Here's the breakdown!\nAtmosphere-\nThis restaurant seems to be disjointed. I really liked the ambiance and feel in the bar area and a small seating area connecting to the main dining area. For some reason, I wasn't feeling it in the main dining area (where we sat). I guess that's the idea and maybe we should have asked to sit in a different area. Part of it may have to do with the fact that we were the youngest people in the place by about 40 years. We could hear the commotion in the kitchen, which was weird because it didn't seem like we were that close to it. Next time I would request to be seated elsewhere.\nService-\nOur waitress was alright, she just seemed a little out of place. She broke a dish on the floor, and overall was a bit sloppy. She was nice enough though, and checked on us an adequate amount. \nFood- \nI loved the fact that there was the option to order petite serving, which upon arrival to our table seemed laughable. But once I started eating, it was the perfect amount of food! I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon and my husband ordered the Crab Cakes. My salmon was delicious and crab cakes decent. However, our sides were just OK. Also my husband's salad seemed straight out of a bag. We were pleasantly surprised at the end of the meal when our server brought us 2 mini chocolate fudge cookies. Mmmmm! The perfect end to the meal!\n\nI might try this place again for drinks\/appetizers or I could see a mother's day brunch here, but overall our dining experience wasn't that memorable.

I was told by the person I originally asked that he was too busy and that I should have talked to him when it first happened (this is the same person I initially talked to who redirected me to the bartended) because our scores are gone.

Was I setting myself up for utter disappointment, or was I going to be enlightened?  White pizza is not exactly the most complicated-looking pizza around, but I only know of one other place that makes a few versions of it spectacularly (Top Tomato in Philly!!!).  \n\nAs serendipity would have it,  I received two pizzas on this date night: one which I had ordered (prochuitto gourmet pizza) and the other that was free (Il Giardino white gourmet pizza) because the free one was apparently sent to my table by accident -- yay!!!  It was a wonderful surprise, because the pizza was fantastic.  The white pizza that eventually came out for me was also very delicious and is definitely in my top 3.  \n\nThe atmosphere, I must add, feels intimate not just because it was small (I would say that it's 1\/10 the size of The Olive Garden) but because on this Thursday date night, there were people who were enjoying themselves around their respective dinner tables like families, even if they really weren't in the same family.","date":1342402453000}

The rooms are nicely appointed and the bed is amazingly comfortable. \n\nIt's a really popular spot for business travelers and it's definitely seen a lot of hard use. That's why I can't give it five stars, because their facilities people don't seem to keep the rooms in fantastic condition nor do the housekeepers do a lot of the 'little things' (like dusting\/cleaning the top of the enormous shower heads or making sure all the drawers are flushed and leveled) that set other places apart.\n\nThe breakfasts are okay, for what they are... it's not the Ritz Carlton or W.A., so anyone who gripes about the food needs to lower their expectations a little. The coffee is kind of horrible but that's okay b\/c there's a Starbucks in the lobby of the Courtyard across the street or one exit up in Ewing. I knew what I was getting (having stayed in other extended-stay type hotels) when I booked my stays and I was not surprised.\n\nAll in all, it's the favorite hotel of my team and we'll continue staying here when we're on assignment in Trenton.\n\nTips:\n\n-East Sushi and Palermo's Pizza are two really good delivery places nearby and the front desk folks will give you menus.\n-Metro Grill is a fairly good sit-down place nearby.\n-Masa 8 is a very good sushi joint about two exits up.\n-Mikonos (Greek) is iffy, probably should avoid it.\n-Buy your beer and wine at the liquor store one exit up (it's in the same shopping center with the Starbucks, plus there's a supermarket there too)... $6\/bottle for a Sam Adams is a little steep.\n-There's also a really good Italian place in that shopping center - Piccolo Trattoria.\n-They have a huge gas grill on the patio at this hotel... another team from my company has done a lot of grilling here, so if you're going to be at the element for a while with a team, it's a great way to hang out and have dinner together.\n-If the lobby music is making you crazy, ask them to turn it down or off... especially later on in the evening if you happen to be in the lobby.","date":1382584169000}

Imagine my surprise when I sat down to my New Year's Eve meal and I saw a brown bear instead of a ginger bear.\n\nI've been excited to know a Top Chef winner has opened up a restaurant a few blocks down my place but I haven't gone for months because I felt somewhat intimidated. The price is of course a little higher and I've always had a distaste for restaurant that only offers taste and not fulfillment. So when it was a few days before X'mas and the few restaurant newsletter ever so \"gently\" reminded me that the New Year's Eve dinner is actually a big deal, I started soul searching for a restaurant that I always wanted to try but haven't had a chance to do so, my mind landed on Sbraga.\n\nThe place has the very same decor that the hipper restaurants in Philly and New York favors, walls lined with wood planks, the very urban wood cabin feel. Silver and black balloons filled up the ceiling for NYE, the place was packed with people. \n\nOn New Year's Eve, they offered a 4-course champagne menu. While it is nice, it's 3-times more expensive with no selection whatsoever and I'm a light-weight drinker, and it was early and I like to choose, so we opted for the regular four-course menu.\n\nI indulged in the rich and surprisingly sweet Foie Gras Soup. It's velvety, almost like a sabayon. For the second course, I had the Sea Bream which I recommend the dish wholeheartedly. The Sea Bream has a really crispy skin, the fish is well cooked. The same can be said about the piece of pork belly in the dish. I also love the squid ink sauce and the calamari \"noodles\". Love it. would eat it again, would even try to make it in my own kitchen. For the third course, I had the fettucine with the perfectly cooked 62 degrees egg. the egg is indeed perfectly cooked, but it's not much different from a pasta carbonara. Maybe even less, since the amount of pasta is little and the dish is recommended to be mixed up, the pasta to egg sauce ratio is a little out of whack. The whole dish is a little more \"decomposed\" than I like it to be. The churro\/coffee creme brulee is a nice finish to the meal. \n\nI wish that the whole meal is more filling, but at the end it wasn't too bad. Me and my friend was debating whether we wanted a sandwich after the meal, but it was fine. Service was good, our server is charming even though he spilled some water. I had a Sbraga Punch which to me tasted very much like cough syrup and he had no problem switching it to the Bell Hop for me which was quite unique and pleasant. Being sat right next to the kitchen also has its perks, other than being right in Sbraga's face, occasionally you'll hear they yell \"Service!\" which it's almost like they're putting on a show for you before you hear it enough and you wonder whether they are having problems with their wait staff. The couple next to us were obviously not a Top Chef fan, since their waitress told them that she'll \"relay their compliments to Kevin\" and they were murmuring to themselves that they had no idea who Kevin was.\n\nWill I go back? I would probably, if a friend hasn't been and suggest to go. Personally, I still like to have a meal that fills me up, especially if I have to pay almost $100 per person.","date":1357236293000}

My personal favorite is their pulled pork. \n\nThe outside patio is great for chilling in the evenings and having some local craft brews (a decent selection), but some areas of the patio have mosquito swarms so be wary of where you sit if you're planning on staying a while.

He showed me an option called a \"puppy plan\" whilst even thought my dog had her first series of shots they still saved me about $100.

It's beautiful and really nice to just walk around and take it all in. My brother and sister have stayed here for an event, and they really enjoyed it, except for the high price tag. The convention center area itself is huge, with gorgeous carpeting, interior decor, etc. all around. There are frequently events and meetings at the convention center, so it's always pretty busy. However, what I really love is the garden area in the center of Opryland. As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the entire area is enclosed, but it really feels like you are outside walking around in an outdoor garden that is always kept at a nice breezy 75 degrees or so. This in itself just amazes me. There are winding paths (nothing super strenuous), waterfalls, and beautiful greenery and flowers everywhere. There are quite a few shops and restaurants all around the hotel, but the pricing is pretty expensive (I will give a shoutout to Stax though -- a delicious make-your-own burger place). Tip: Park in the back near the Opry Mills Mall and take a short (5 min) walk to a side\/back entrance of Opryland. You will save $20+ from not parking in the front.","date":1431453183000}

He had the Cuban Benedict special, which had an excellent flavor. They have great food specials for dinner and brunch, but some of our dinner favorites include the savory chicken waffle small plate (shareable) and the Lloyd Burger.  \n\nYou can't go wrong with drinks. The bourbon sweet tea is amazing, and the Manhattan was one of the best I've ever had. We have also tried some of their whiskey flights, which are reasonably priced and great whiskeys that we might not have otherwise stumbled upon.

We had originally booked our swamp tour with Dr. something or other and they were horrible so we jumped ship (no pun intended) and booked with Cajun Encounters. I am so glad that we did! \n\nWe opted to take the bus from NOLA and was glad that we did. Our driver was so-so and he attempted to give us a tour from town out to the dock but sadly it was lacking (this is why I am deducting half a star...you will see why the other half star deduction...just keep reading). I think there was a language barrier and that kind of sucked. Oh, and he was 30 minutes late. That was a little frustrating. We took the first tour so this meant I could have spent an extra 30 minutes sleeping. Boo!\n\nOnce we got there we checked in and it was rather chaotic (the other half star deduction). You walk in and see a long line for tickets. The bad thing was that it is in the center of the gift shop. That made shopping rather difficult. This is probably not a good thing for revenue. The dumb this was that there was a register in the back...which was closed! \n\nThe tour itself was great! Our guide was friendly and very knowledgeable. I really enjoyed him. He gave us a history of the swamp and offered tons of info about the elusive gators of the bayou. We saw a number of them and even got to hold a baby. How awesome is that? Let me tell you, it was pretty darn awesome! I highly recommend that you request a covered boat. The poor people with the open boat were sweating like you couldn't believe.

I am very glad we did because we find all kinds of deals here.  Granted, we sometimes \"over-shop\" because of low prices, but with the savings we are actually breaking even.\n\nHow do I know prices are good?  Well I am one of those people that, for whatever reason, tends to memorize prices from my other grocery retailers whether I want to or not.  For example, a 20 ounce Red Bull here is $2.40 while the exact same thing at another store is in the $4.50+ range.  \n\nJust this past weekend we bought a Keurig K300 for $80.80.  The same item retailed for over $100 at several other places nearby.\n\nSo why just 3.5 stars if I am saving money and am now flush with cash*?  Well the downside is that unlike a typical grocery chain you cannot necessarily find all the brands you are looking for when shopping.  That makes it inevitable that I have to make a trip to a separate store if I have specific needs which cannot be met at IGA.

Born at East Jefferson General Hospital, my son was quickly transferred to Children's Hospital New Orleans (CHNOLA) with a life- threatening illness.\n\nWe found ourselves in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and I can honestly say that this is one of the best units in the hospital. Our son was immediately assessed and within a few hours, was already being tested to diagnose his condition.  Within 8 hours and after a host of tests, our son was diagnosed and assigned a neonatologist, 3 separate specialists and a nurse. \n\nHis treatment began immediately and we spent nearly a month in the NICU.  Parents are allowed to stay at their child's side with the exception of shift changes from 7:00-8:00 am and 7:00-8:00 pm.  I hope no parent ever has to experience what my wife and I felt, but looking back now, we can honestly say that the NICU is the best unit unit in the hospital; and we have visited many of the clinics there for his follow up visits.\n\nWe spent every single day with our son and got to personally know every doctor and nurse assigned to him for the day.  It takes a special doctor or nurse to work in the NICU, and the nurses are like angels.  The NICU nurses, for lack of a better term, are like surrogate parents to the sick children they care for.  It is more than a job to them.  Watching them care for my son and his roommate (most NICU rooms are double occupancy), I quickly learned that the nurses are totally committed to their patients.  Many of the children in the NICU are from cities across the state and some parents can only come to visit on the weekends as they have to work to pay their bills. But the nurses hold them and rock them and talk to them as if they were their parents.  Seeing them in action is a humbling experience, but an experience I hope that none of you ever experience.\n\nWe have only had to visit the E.R. twice and it is a top notch facility.  However, there are so many patients waiting to be seen (every day) that the wait can easily exceed 5-6 hours.  What's worse is that many of the patients and their parents are coughing and possibly spreading germs throughout the E.R.  If you do find yourself in the E.R., I would suggest waiting in the hallway with your child while he\/she is waiting to be seen.  Hopefully you can avoid leaving with an illness that you didn't arrive with.\n\nOnce a patient is discharged from CHNOLA. they are often assigned to follow up visits at one or more of the hospital's many clinics. One of the most overworked clinic is the hemotology\/oncology clinic.  If you ever find yourself a patient of this clinic, make sure you bring at least 2 or 3 extra bottles for your child as the wait time from checking in, to triage, to lab and then being seen in the clinic can easily exceed 6 hours.  Everyone there on their staff is very nice.  However, the staff is completely overworked and booked solid from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.  Do yourself a favor and book the earliest appointment you can.  You'll be glad that you did.\n\nOn a more positive note, I have nothing but great things to say about both the occupational therapy clinic and physical therapy clinic.  Both clinics are appointment only and if you are late, you are not allowed at all to infringe upon the next patient's time slot; which is the way it should be.  The therapists are are great and are truly excited and enthusiastic about their jobs; and it shows.\n\nMany of the patients in CHNOLA are there for a long time, and ther parents often spend time in hotels occasionally so that they can spend more time with their child without having to go home.  The CHNOLA cafeteria offers deeply discounted meals to parents of admitted patients, and we spent a solid month eating breakfast, lunch and dinner there.  It's just a small way for the hospital to offer something back to the parent, and the food is actually quite good.\n\nI gues the best thing about CHNOLA is the attitude of the staff.  Overall, everyone is extremely nice and sympathetic to your needs.  Most parents are already in a fragile state and the staff recognizes this and does their best to accomodate you.  \n\nThe only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the extremely long wait times in some of the clinics.  Hopefully through the yearly telethons, donations and possiible government assistance, the hospital can obtain the necessary finding to increase its staffing relative to its patients needs.","date":1354673013000}

I've been here twice but both were absolutely incredible dining experiences. Both times I visited were during brunch hours so my reviews will be based on that menu. \n\nMy first bit of advice is, if you haven't been before and want to know what to order, the answer is the Cyprus Breakfast. This meal, and it is quite filling, has everything you could want for a brunch. Two extra crispy fried eggs, a big slab of ham, two pieces of a fried Mediterranean cheese, some delicious bread and a salad, all together on one glorious plate. My fianc\u00e9 and I both ordered each time we went because it is that good!  This past trip, I also ordered the lamb sandwich, which was also amazing. Large chunks of lamb and lots of fresh herbs on a soft roll.  Another menu item I'm dying to try is the rabbit soup that was on special. The way it looked on the table next to me had me wishing there was room left in my stomach. For dessert the answer is the galaktoboureko. I know this is a complicated word but if you just the gala they'll know what you mean. It's a warm rich custard with a layer of crispy phyllo dough on the top and bottom, drizzled in orange infused syrup. It's outstanding. \n\nKanella is special because of more than just the food. They have an amazing staff. We had the same young waiter both times we went. He was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Usually you don't remember the waiter and if you do, it's never for good reasons. The service here actually enhances the experience. On top of that, there was a family with an elderly man in a wheel chair coming to dine here while we were eating. I saw the chef (who I believe is also the owner) leave the kitchen, go outside and help the man in through a back entrance and actually wheel him all the way up to his seat at the table. Honestly, this was really touching to see. \n\nI couldn't recommend Kanella more highly. I will be back again soon!","date":1297721333000}

While there weren't any vegetarian options listed the waitress let me know they could make almost anything meatless. Score! I truly enjoyed my dinner of corn cakes & veggies annnnd the guacamole we had as an app. The tres leches cake was fantastic as well. Ambiance was nice & I'd totally recommend this to someone looking for a date night location. We'll absolutely return. Edit: we tried their brunch! Like some folks have mentioned, it's not super busy. Totally a win because I hate waiting forever and a day when I'm most likely famished and hung over. My sister and I split the breakfast tacos & the veggie omelet. The tacos were amazing! I wish they offered these a la carte. (I'd just have four of them plus a cocktail.) Each dish came with breakfast potatoes. I love potatoes. Looooove. While the seasoning was really delicious, they weren't all the way cooked through and had that raw taste still. Bummer. They gave us a flan as apology and it was killer. (I still would've rather had cooked potatoes but seriously classy save, Delicia.) I'll return. Next time I'll skip the omelet and potatoes for tacos and fruit if they'll sub it. A solid place to recover on Sunday early afternoons though.","date":1462589852000}

They also have a lot of fun trinkets that would make good gifts--things like Better-Than-A-Boyfriend soap, snarky fridge magnets, and bacon flavored gum.  They also sell some locally made goods, such as purses made from the roof of the old RCA dome.  Somewhat surprisingly, they sell furniture as well.  The location is nice, right next to Starbucks on Mass Ave.\n\nThe reason I give it 3 stars is that it seems really overpriced.  I'm not a jewelry expert, so I can't comment on those prices.  They may be quite legitimate.  A lot of the jewelry is really beautiful, and made by artists.  But all of the gifty items cost at least twice what I would have expected.  There may be a reason for this that I'm not aware of--I do know that some items are printed on recycled paper and reused materials.  I respect that.  But other items really seem unreasonable, like the $8 bar of soap or the $20 bento box.  As someone who has to live on a budget, this is a bit of a turn off.  But the place was full of people on a Sunday morning, so maybe I'm just getting old and cranky.  It is obviously a very popular store in Indianapolis.  To each their own, I guess!","date":1311949193000}

We were a party of 7 adults and 2 children, and were seated in an area with other children, which is fine with me - might as well keep all the noise in one area  :-)\n\nI had the Chicken Jack and Bacon sandwich, which had a good size hunk of chicken in it, along with the cheese, bacon, tomato and onion, but strangely absolutely no sauce or dressing of any kind, making it rather dry.  Other than that, it was good, and everyone else seemed content with their meal.  Our server was attentive and patient, and all our meals were served at the same time, eliminating that awkward \"waiting\" stage that often happens with larger parties.\n\nHowever, there was bad news - the children's meal no longer includes a dessert of Dirt and Worms, which (as silly as it may seem) has always been the main attraction of Tony Roma's if kids are along.   We had to pay an extra dollar for a small scoop of freezer-burned vanilla ice cream which neither child finished, nor any adult wanted to eat because of the crystallization of it.  It's funny how Dirt and Worms has become a tradition for us, and the meal didn't seem complete without it.  Hey, Tony, you may have lost some customers over that pudding and cookie crumbs and gummy worm \"cost-cutting\" elimination.  Others may value you for your ribs, but for us it was the giggles over chocolate-covered faces that made us leave with a smile on our faces.","date":1406534613000}

I first found the Manayunk location, and my wife and I ate there several times.  We heard about it from a friend who turned us on to the spicy cucumbers, which are just wonderful.\n\nEventually I tried the University City location, and it's much more \"hip.\"  I really don't care about ambiance, but if you are seeking a more polished\/trendy type of place, go to University City over Manayunk.  The food in both places is just incredible.\n\nHan Dynasty serves food in very large, family sized portions.  It's most fun when you are with a bit of a group, so you can order a number of different things, and try them all.\n\nOn their \"specials\" menu, they have Spicy Aroma Fish which is just absolutely beyond this world.  SO good.  Another major hit was the dry pot style.  My wife and I are big seafood fans, so we get shrimp as the protein, but you have complete flexibility to pick whichever protein suits your taste.\n\nThey have numbers on the menu, 1-10, beside each dish.  This is the relative spiciness rating.  It's really hard to describe the type of heat in these Szechuan dishes... it isn't the kind of heat that just burns your mouth.  The heat is very strong, but it's all flavor.  \n\nDry pepper style is another type of preparation that we have tried and loved.\n\nSeveral reviews mention the Dan Dan noodles... they are wonderful, but they are indeed rather oily.  It's just the nature of this cuisine.  I think the food is wonderfully prepared, one just has to know that chili oil and sesame oil will make the food a bit on the oily side.  \n\nAbsolute top notch rating for this place.

The cheeses (which are listed on a separate part of the menu--make sure not to overlook them!) are served with sliced bread and are paired with various toppings.  Ours came with fresh honey and some kind of tapenade.       \n\nIt's somewhat pricey but not exorbitant, which we had anticipated.

Let me start by saying that we reserved a room for our wedding night.  The next morning we had a very early flight to Montego Bay so we checked out of our room around 5:30 a.m. the next morning.  We actually had no complaints until we tried to use our debit card on a large purchase in Jamaica on our honeymoon and it was denied.  OK, this special time that only happens once in your life.... was completely ruined because this hotel charged our account 3 TIMES for the room amount at a whopping $240 a pop. We only left a small amount in our checking account because we were travelling out of country (just in case something happened and someone got our card number or something).  After getting charged $19.99 per MB to check our bank account using data on my cell phone, we discovered this MESS that Courtyard put us in.  \n\nWe had planned on a couple's massage by the beach in Jamaica but that couldn't happen!  Plans on our honeymoon were ruined and I am still very upset!!!\n\nAfter getting back into the states on a Saturday evening, I called the hotel to try and figure out what as going on.  I was told that a manager would have to speak with me and she would not be in until Tuesday.  I was forwarded to her voicemail and left a message.  The manager finally got back with me and she stated that she had no idea what was going on.  I explained to her my process through booking: I am a Marriott Rewards Member so I just logged into my account and booked a room.  After realizing that I would not be about to check into the room at check in since our wedding was at 4pm I called the hotel and added my husband to the account so that he could check into the room.  I also asked about how much the deposit for the room would be since Marriott usually charges a deposit in case of any charges.  The lady told me that it varies per hotel and I told her that I needed to know (since we were only transferring a certain amount into our checking).  She called the hotel and then finally got back on the line with me... she said that the deposit would not be more than $50.  When he went to check in he told them he wasn't sure what name the reservation was under it could have been either one of our last names. They found the reservation and got him checked in.  We checked out at 5:30 a.m. the next morning and that was all we knew.  The manager had then figured out what had happened: They created a new reservation for my husband and then charged me for a NO SHOW on my reservation.  The third charge was the pre-authorization that showed $220!  Let me re-cap:  They charged me 2 TIMES FOR THE ROOM and screwed up the check in.  THEN... they neglected to let us know that the pre-authorization and the room cost would be charged in the same amount on the same day of check in!  They also charged us for parking!  We had already parked our car in a parking garage and did not park with them!   The manager acted as if it was my husbands fault for creating a new reservation.   I assured her that he absolutely knew that we had a reservation and wouldn't have created a new reservation that it must have been her staff that messed up!  \n\nShe credited my account for the no-show, told me that the pre-authorization takes 7 business days to fall off of the account, and then credited me for the parking.  She did credit back all fraudulent charges to our account!  However, she can never replace what we lost on our honeymoon all because of their screw ups and neglect in informing us about the pre-authorization and room charge on the same day!  (Basically it showed up twice in one day right after another... which makes no sense... usually a pre-authorization is charged to hold the money and then the balance is updated... like when you leave a tip at a restaurant... not two separate charges!).\n\nRidiculous!!","date":1367940735000}

The room was not bad but nowhere near $179 a night. Allow me to explain. For starters the breakfast that was included in the price was pathetic. The eggs were powered, all of the food that was supposed to be hot wasn't even warm. The staff had a hard time keeping fresh silverware stocked and what little food they offered. This breakfast is not worth spending the extra money in booking this hotel. The shuttle service left us at bush gardens new years eve because they claim we didn't make reservations to and from because there shuttle bus could only hold 8 people. We went to the front desk and watched them put our name and room number on the schedule and they still were able to screw that up. I had to call the hotel at 12:20 a.m. 01--1-2015 and spoke with one of the managers about our situation being stranded after making reservations and she wasn't even apologetic. She told me to get a cab and the hotel would reimburse me. I explained to her there were no cabs in sight and she claimed there was nothing she could do. We had to walk to the hotel 1\/2 mile away on new years, thanks hyatt.. \nOur bathroom was so small you couldn't even close the door without having to step into the shower. Also at 3:30 a.m. there is a very loud train that comes through and blows a very loud horn that alarmed everyone we spoke with staying at the hotel. After this experience we will Never book anything with hyatt because it was very disappointing after spending $400 for 2 nights to receive this kind of service...

My order was the drunk chicken with a vegetarian option for only 7.50! I was very surprised with the affordability of a full plate. Since I ordered to go I received my food in a simple styrofoam clam shell container. The presentation was pretty lackluster, but food doesn't need a fancy container or complicated presentation to be delicious, that's exactly what this was!

She gave us a brief tour, answered some of our inquisitive questions about the house, renovations, etc, and then were shown our room. \n\nShe was very flexible with whatever time we wanted breakfast, which comes with your reservation, which we thought was quite considerate.  \n\nSpeaking of breakfast, it was just absolutely excellent both mornings.  My husband and I both commented that she could be a chef, the breakfast was that good.  It was a nice assortment of fresh fruit, cheesy grits, scones, french toast and an egg souffle type of baked dish.  We were pleasantly surprised at the delicious offerings.\n\nWe stayed in one of their King Suite rooms, and it was wonderful.  Very comfortable room with a great king bed and linens, walk in shower, working wifi, and high windows that let in great natural light.  \nIt was our first time staying at a B&B and we were understandably concerned the other guests could be noisy, or we'd wake people up when going\/coming...not the case.  The house was pretty quiet, kept at a cool temperature (very important in the early September high humidity days!), and just overall very beautiful.  It is clear that when Linda renovated it, she didn't cut any corners--every finish and decoration is fabulous.\n\nThe only downside is grabbing a cab isn't as easy staying here as it would be if you were staying at a larger hotel on Canal Street in the French Quarter.  But, the quietness and quaint B&B experience at Terrell absolutely made up for that.\n\nWe both highly recommend Terrell House.  In fact, we hope to go back again someday if we are headed back to NOLA!","date":1347295498000}

I ended up with red nail polish all over the edges of my skin and she couldn't be bothered to clean it up. She passed me onto someone else after my nails were done curing and I got the most pathetic little hand massage ever and was sent on my way.

Everything was 5 stars, even the potato was excellent! \n\nI was sufficiently stuffed, but it's kind of pricey, so you got to dig in and go for the uncomfortable stomach for a couple hours, so I grabbed another plate, and loaded up crab legs, mussels, and peel and eat shrimp.

She was (*gasp* ) very attentive for an Ethiopian restaurant waitress.  The service was not as good quick as the average non-Ethiopian restaurant, but it definitely blew all the Ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed!  Gee, I wonder if it could be because she's not Ethiopian?!?!?!  hahaha  However, she did mention that she grew up in West Philly eating Ethiopian food.  mmmm I'm jealous!  \n\nAs is my custom, I went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal.  Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one's hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two \"stalls\" in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.  Needless to say, I did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in.  PLEASE LADIES, GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT.  It is a harrowing experience!\n\nWhen the food came (sooner than expected), the portions were fairly generous.  When I bit into the injera at the Queen of Sheba, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fairly sour!  It was not as sour as Abyssinia's injera, but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else I have tried up to date.  Now, I'm not saying ideal injera should be sour, but I like mine that way.   hahaha  Unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried.  *sigh*   It's a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera.   \n\nThe dishes were all decent, but not amazing.  My companion liked the potatoes in the carrot, string bean, potato dish.  I thought their salad was fabulous - fresh and dressed perfectly.  I did not care for the raw onions, but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes.  Both lentil dishes were decent, as I have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them.  However, my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at Kaffa Crossing.  I know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me, but I am a big, Big wuss when it comes to spices, so that is neither here nor there.   The lamb was a big disappointment, it was a little sour (bad?).  The collard greens were pretty standard, nothing amazing.","date":1249360663000}

I talked to the young ladies working and said what a pleasant experience it was shopping there. They told me the items offered are taken from overstock that would typically be warehoused. They do not pull from existing merchandise at GWs but from items that would be warehoused because there is no room for them in the GW store. So for those who still wish to treasure hunt at GW this does not preempt that thrill.\n\nFor me, though, I liked that the items were somewhat more selective than a typical GW. I found three shirts which on any given day I would look at 3 different GWs around town and not find one. My total cost on them was $19.25. An Old Navy, Lee Rider and Tommy Bahama ($10 of the $19). For me it was more akin to consignment shopping and priced accordingly. \n\nI definitely think it's worth a look on any given day.

The pictures of the burger look so amazing how can you not want to just eat your phone BUT the BBQ oysters at Red Fish Grill I know are amazing BUT the BBQ shrimp cooked in spices and herb butter at Deanies are so highly regarded.  SO where would you eat if it was your last lunch of a great NO trip?  Hard to choose, right?  Wrong!!  We went to all three and were not disappointed in the least.  I suggest you do the same.  \nStart at Lukes and split the $16 dollar burger kinda pricey but very tasty.  Then Walk over to Red Fish Grill and eat  two orders of their BBQ Oysters (you'll feel cheated if you get just one order) with an Ice cold beer. Now realistically that should be enough for lunch but its only fish, not too filling? \nNow onto Deanies to sit at the bar and eat these amazing shrimp, however, I'm not sure what was better the shrimp or the loaf of French bread to dip into the butter with and washed down with an ice cold Heferweisen on tap!!! My God was it satisfying. I haven't felt that satisfied since my \"first time\"!!! Screw the calories I'm in Nawleans! Now I think I know what a junkie must go thru when he needs his fix.  You can't just get these flavors anywhere you know. \nAnd if all of the above wasn't enough like too idiots we walked to Caf\u00e9 du Mond for coffee and beignets. \nWe took a cab back to the hotel because we obviously could not walk, had a quickie and took a nap so we could dine at GW FINS which was also a fantastic experience.

I looked online for kickboxing classes in Santa Barbara and stumbled upon Paragon. After reading the various Yelp reviews, I decided to sign up for an orientation class, initially for the Kickboxing program. Sean Apperson, the co-owner of the gym, quickly responded to my email and worked around my full-time job to schedule a one on one class. I then expressed through email that I was also interested in the Jiu Jitsu program at Paragon, and he was extremely open to provide an introduction to both sports.\n\nLet me start off by saying that I have no background in martial arts or wrestling. I am female who has stayed active my entire life, but starting a new sport with no previous experience can be very intimidating, especially when there are a lot of guys taking the classes. When I walked in my first day, Sean was in the midst of a training session and was rolling with a female purple belt.... it definitely intrigued me. Sean looked up from the mat and proceeded to introduce himself with a big smile on his face and right away I felt at ease. We started with an introduction class in Jiu Jitsu and my nervousness disappeared when I realized how Sean went out of his way to make sure that I was comfortable. He was extremely encouraging throughout the training, we worked on basic technique and even laughed when I made a fool of myself (which happened a lot that first day). When the introduction class was over, I was so excited that I had found a new sport and signed up to join the gym right away.\n\nAfter that first orientation class, I continued to attend beginner classes with nerves about how the training would go and how other athletes would perceive me. However, those nerves quickly faded after building a friendship with my fellow classmates and instructors. Everyone at the gym is extremely welcoming, approachable, and willing to work with you regardless of your level of training. 'Family' is the word that comes to mind when I think of the athletes at the gym because there is a feeling of love and respect for each other, while still pushing each other to succeed. It's a great feeling when you walk into the gym and the instructors and other athletes greet you by name and have actual conversations with you.\n\nAlso, Paragon is a very clean facility. They have a huge mat space, boxing ring, weights, cardio machines.. and they have just expanded into a bigger space, which is very exciting!! The large mat space is great for the classes and the locker rooms are clean and tidy. The shower area may be nicer than my shower at home! It's open 7 days a week and they offer classes at different times throughout the day, so you can work around your schedule.\n\nI am so glad I joined Paragon BJJ and Kickboxing. Not only have I embarked on a new lifestyle, but have met an amazing group of people who are inspiring and fun to be around. I would definitely recommend Paragon to anyone, don't hesitate and sign up!","date":1376583613000}

It's very modern and chic in a way. Love the creativity of the door handle being a rolling pin, the light fixtures as wire whip mixers, and incorporating the love sign into a beautiful center piece for the top back wall. Everything was very artsy and creative. I noticed the bright displays of cupcakes and assorted treats and most of all, the gorgeously decorated occasion cakes (HINT HINT: weddings are their specialty). They blew me away! It's like something you'd only see on TV! \n\nWe couldn't resist ordering their uniquely flavored cupcakes. Chocolate cake with raspberry icing and lavender something with pistachio icing. Plus, if you find a purple center in your cupcake, you can get another one for free. (Definitely NOT a marketing scheme, but I admire the game even though we're being played.)\n\nTo get to the point: the first thing I tried was the icing.. it was literally so hard I had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite. I feel like I would've like it if it was softer and more like icing? The chocolate cake was like any other. My fianc\u00e9e's cupcake was strange!! The icing literally tasted like stale, natural butter (or maybe more closely similar to lard!? If you ever tasted lard, you'll know that distinct flavor it has.) The icing was also hard as a rock. However, the lavender mixed (don't know what with) cake wasn't half bad, though nothing stood out to me as special.\n\nIffy on whether or not we'll be back.

On a recent weekend trip to Philly, we stayed at the Hotel Monaco, parked our car, and enjoyed the area. Because our weekend was packed with family events, Red Owl offered a place for us to stop in for a quick bite or drink, without the stuffy hotel bar\/restaurant feel.  \n\nIn a three day period, we somehow managed to experience happy hour, drinks, and brunch. The charcuterie platter was substantial and thoughtfully crafted, the perfect pair to a locally brewed pint. Also recommended: the donuts.\n\nBrunch menu items range from healthy to traditional; the potatoes are delicious. Note that the bloody marys are chock full of horseradish--I enjoy a spicy bloody, but we had to order extra tomato juice to balance the flavor.\n\nAll in all, Red Owl took the guesswork out of navigating the neighborhood between events, offering variety and friendly service to keep us coming back.","date":1384439643000}

I do not normally write reviews that hurt companies but this experience warrants one.\n\nMy mother and father moved from St. Louis up to Chicago and my parents are older and therefore needed the help of movers.  I could not help them move because I was in middle of moving myself.  I wish I had moved at a different time because my parents could not have been in worse hands.\n\nThe caliber of employees\/movers they sent to help my mom were horrible.  I will just list some key moments during the move.\n\n\n-Telling my mother \"Don't you have a husband\" whenever she asked them to move something to another spot.... It was agreed upon and paid for that they would do this extra work.  My parents are older!  They are not able to move these things anymore.\n\n-Lewd subject matters for conversation were audibly projected through the neighborhood and in front my parents.\n\n-Argumentative when asked to move certain things to the basement.  Again, this was agreed upon to be done when Mayflower was hired.\n\n-After getting upset about moving things to the basement, the movers proceeded to intentionally drop and slam items around the house.  Many items are now permanently damaged.\n\n\nWe called and complained about the movers behavior and the customer service representative told us that the mover who argued and slammed items would not be paid.  This does not really fix any problems.\n\n\nI will make sure to tell people to hire anyone but Mayflower.

We frequented the Lafayette location often and were very disappointed in the service and quality of the Avon location where we now reside.  Tonight we followed our daughter and her family to the Avon location (unaware of where they had decided to go for dinner). This evening topped  the list of terrible restaurant experiences-over an hour wait for food, my daughters steak was cooked well done when ordered medium rare, the steak was remade which had to be boxed and was left at the table because was still cooked incorrectly.  She was charged 9.99 for the remake and that is what was taken off her bill not the price of the original steak&rib dinner.  I ordered the apple pie desert with ice cream which came out before we even received our drinks and without a spoon.  My husband drove back to the location where the manager refused to do anything different about the original charge for the incorrectly cooked steak; needless to say my husband left with the owners phone number.  Mistakes happen - but own them; every bad experience is related to over 20 people, who then in turn, repeat to someone else - so tell me manager of Avon, IN Texas Roadhouse - was it worth it?","date":1464659784000}

The past three times in a row I've been there, there has been some sort of ridiculous customer service issue that left me and whoever I was with super annoyed.\n\nStarting with the good: the coffee is delicious. The assortment of baked goods is great...quiche is yummy, etc. I've always loved the space...good mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops. Plenty of outdoor seating on nice days.\n\nThe prices are...steep. BUT I always feel good about supporting a local small business, so whatever. My real problem is the 'tude and just general lack of professionalism that I've seen from the baristas. They clearly know their coffee, and that's great, but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month:\n\n--purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar. My mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a head's up. His answer: \"Yeah, we're actually out of half and half.\" Everyone stared blankly at him, including the other people in line. Now mind you, it was before noon, not five minutes before they closed. No apology, no \"I'm so sorry, we sent someone down the street to the 7-11 (literally down the street) to pick some up, they should be back any minute.\" That was it. The guy behind us asked, \"is anyone going to get some more?\" and the kid literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us. Ummmmmm. As my mom said, when you charge people $8 for two coffees (one of which was just a drip coffee), I don't think it's too much to ask that you provide HALF AND HALF AT YOUR COFFEE SHOP. \n\n--another time I was there, a friend asked for her coffee extra hot, and then when it arrived just warm, she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute. She was very nice about it. The girl behind the counter, on the other hand, felt it necessary to explain in a condescending tone for five minutes that they \"actually can't put the coffee cups in the microwave\" for some reason I now forget, and then reluctantly offered to add some hot water. Uhhhh. Homegirl. Could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem? Put it in a to go cup and microwave it? This doesn't seem like THAT hard of a problem to solve, nor can I imagine it's the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot. Again, everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened. \n\n--this is a small thing, but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board, but then half of them apparently only come in one size? I know it's a small issue, but you'd think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they don't have to keep telling people (last time I was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me). \n\nJersey Java owners, please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service. Again, they know their coffee, and they're generally nice until there's ANY sort of minor hiccup, and then all basic common sense goes right out the window. Your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time I go there. Oh, and buy more half and half.","date":1446820732000}

All the workers are friendly and work so hard to keep the line that is usually out the door under control.

It's right off the interstate and if you go in there over night there is always a police officer.(I think the police officer is there because of the amount of customers in there at one time). Let's just start with the donuts. They r amazing. They have the best donuts around. I love donuts so I have been to just about every donut shop in the Nola area. And these r the best!!!  The donuts are usually hot and they can usually make any special order u want. All U have to do is ask. Whenever I want special orders I call early in the morning and they can usually have it done by noon. The apple fritters here are so good as well!!!  Red velvet cake and Reese peanut butter are my favorites oh wait the Oreo donut is just as good!  Next let's move on to kastleburgers... These kastleburgers are a New Orleans original and no one can top them. These people have to entire process of cooking kastleburgers down to a science. ( or so it appears). I have seen the crystal across the street but any one that is local knows tastee's kastleburgers are so Much better. Does anyone even go to crystal?  Also just like the donuts you can Special order the kastleburgers. They are always made  fresh. The breakfast is so good as well. They use real products. It is defiantly made to order and not typical fast food breakfast. U can order anything u can imagine for breakfast. I have seen people eating hot sausage egg and cheese sandwiches and I have seen all different types of breakfast platters served. They also have a huge selections of po boys and sandwiches that u can order 24\/7. Now the hot plates they serve here are so good. They have everything and it's all home cooked u can taste it. It reminds me of when I was little and my grandma fixed me red beans and rice. They also have this pasta defiantly homemade it is so good it has crawfish and shrimp in it.  The gumbo is good as well. All I can say is pass up all other donut shops and come her for the full New Orleans style donut experience. This is an old time genuinely good donut shop the donuts taste the same as they did when I was a child it's so nice to have a restaurant\/ donut shop that doesnt take the easy way out cut corners and produce a not so good product.

Menu here:\n\nhttps:\/\/universityclub.iupui.edu\/Reservations\/Weekly-Menu\n\nExcellent service; my sponsor took me and other staff visiting the school this summer, for a buffet lunch.  The waitstaff were prompt in filling our waters and inquiring about more plates, and also served us whenever we requested (we asked that 2 portions of the red velvet cake be split 3 ways, and the result was prompt and precise, with extra small plates).  She was cheery and interacted with us professionally, even if this wasn't (I don't think) a private sector job driven by Yelp reviews and employee performance surveys.\n\nThe menu itself feels as if it's trying to demonstrate global culinary awareness on a very limited budget.  A couple of salad-y items including cornbread salad, a lively green (spinach) salad, and 2 other choices, plus various dressings that did not come out of a generic commercial bottle.  A couple of starches then proteins including a savory-sweet tofu entry--it was like the spicy peanut butter tofu I make at home, but more breaded and gunky and thus less spicy; a \"kalbi\" meat thing which was sweet and savory, soy sauce style, and kinda clumpy, but tried to hit the Korean flavor profile; and a couple of other animal meat options (uh, fish?).  Some inventiveness for trying to do something for foodies in this very countrified and simultaneously urban environment, I guess.  Culinary diversity efforts are always appreciated, even if the textures were not excellent.\n\nMy guess is they're operating with limited funding and staff, but there's some smart guy or gal doing the menu design, trying to figure how to make this stuff onthe line in a way that doesn't taste mass produced, but that also doesn't violate their financial dictates.  The food was tasty, not old, and satisfying without being too sweet, oily, or salty.\n\nPretty good job, all said.","date":1500426777000}

Lemon artichoke soup was cooked to the point it lost a lot of identity and tasted like a vegetable soup. Those that like a great lemon Greek style soup, this isn't it. Chunky avacado salad was light and excellent. My favorite thing I ate. Crab cake had good lump crab, but a bit too much breading. Chicken salad was good without being remarkable.

We came here to end our family vacation, knowing it was going to be pricey. I'd urge everyone to look into the costs up front, so you don't have any surprises on check out. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and it was really quick. The rep was knowledgeable and friendly and gave instructions on how to find our room. The room was the cheapest they had, but still really nice, and very clean. We dropped our stuff off and explored. There is so much to see and so much to do. Some of the activies are free, like the fountain show in the evenings, but most aren't, such as the riverboat ride or the spa services. \nDinner our first night was at the Cantina. Prices are decent, and the service was good. Our second night we ate at Piaso (pizza). The pizza was good, for the price. Generous servings for $4. Friendly service and a decent selection of wines. There are at least three coffee houses that I counted, and all serve Starbucks coffee. \nThere are three pools - one indoor and two outdoor. The Cascades Outdoor Pool has already 1.5' small pool that was perfect for our three year old, and the larger pool went up to 4'6\" which was great for our 8 year old. There is a great locker room by the Cascades Indoor Pool that has showers, a hair dryer, and restrooms. \nOverall my family and I had a great time, and I don't regret the money we spent for the two nights we were here (which was a lot).

When my chicken cheesesteak was put in front of me today I had to ask the waiter if the cook accidentally used only half the normal portion of meat. I've never seen such an empty steak sandwich in my life and easily housed the whole thing, plus the measly pickle spear and miniature bag of chips. \n\nAfter confronting the waiter he asked me if I wanted another and I told him \"no, not if this is the normal portion size. Do they always look so empty?\" I won't quote the waiter exactly but his reply was along the lines of that's the normal portion size but the chef doesn't know what he's doing and that's why it looks small. \n\nThis was a disgrace of a cheesesteak, and thus worthy of a 2 star review considering all the times I've eaten here in the past have been a solid \"Meh\".","date":1273869336000}

Perfect, now everything is getting better because I have something to coat my stomach...I don't need anything special so I just ask the waiter where the enchiladas are without really looking at the menu and says \"2 enchiladas coming up\".  I love it.  Then I looked over and saw someone that had margaritas -- and I really really wanted one but I was trying to not drink that night.  Man, Michas delivered and they gave me extra fillers to fatten me up.  I walked out feeling good about this experience and I will absolutely go back here again.

It was all because of the nail tech, i didn't get her name but she was young, Vietnamese with a med length bob haircut. I went in for a gel color polish change. Her work is not as neat as what im use to there. She for some reason placed two scolding hot towels over each of my hands while removing the old color. I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked 'is this better princess \".  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I've had a gel polish color change several times before, no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER,  i don't know why she did. After the gel color polish was applied and dry she repeatedly reapplied a top thick coat over and over. I kept having to place my hands under the uv light again, thats never happened before either.

What?  An hour+ for three sandwiches?  They said they were slammed.  We could see three open tables outside and two other tables seated after us had already received food.  Lots of \"I'm sorries\" from the wait staff.  We insisted on a complimentary round of drinks (which they did agree to).\n\nWhen the food finally came, the Roast Pork sandwich and fries were completely cold (guess that was the half that was done on time).

This restaurant is extremely small, and if there aren't any seats, you are welcome to stand in the back by the bar without seating, in the way of all the commotion. We stood by the bar for about ten minutes before we were asked if we needed something. We wanted to eat, but not standing up. We saw multiple tables open up, and had to ask if we could sit there, even though we were the only people waiting. We finally sat, and a young,brunette waitress came and took our order. We wanted two orders of the Short Rib fries appetizer, since we would be having it as our dinner opposed to sharing it, and she looked at us like we asked her to bring the whole cow to our table. She asked us if we were sure that we wanted two, and we confirmed that we did. The first order came out in about 5 minutes which was amazing. 10 minutes went by, then 15, and our server didn't even come over to see how our first dish was, just stood in the corner chatting. We got another servers attention after 20 minutes of waiting and let him know we were still waiting on our order. We also advised him that if it wasn't ready, to forget about it and we would share the first one. He came back and told us that it would be out any second. Another ten minutes went by, still no dish, still nothing from our original server. We let the young man know that we were no longer interested in the dish that was 25 minutes late, and then our original server finally decided to come over! Could you believe the first thing she said was \"so im hearing that you never got the second batch of fries?\". As if it was some kind of rumor. Then had the nerve to ask if we still wanted it. She took it off the bill but I was extremely disappointed with the service, and will certainly not return the next time I am in town. Especially since I got sick in the middle of the night from it.

In our group, there were two adults and four children, ages 14, 13, 5 and 3. The waitress brought our drinks and took our order quite efficiently. When the food arrived, one five-stack of buttermilk pancakes were missing. My daughter had to sit and watch everyone eat for some time, while the waitress made promises each trip past our table. Knowing she was starving, I finally gave her one f my three pancakes so she had something in front of her while she waited.\n\nFinally, her order arrived and she began eating. The waitress left my bill on the table - $54. I had ordered the Colorado Omelette which was quite good but when I finished most of it and started on my pancakes, I got a nasty nasty surprise. With the second bite of my pancakes, something felt wrong in my mouth. I reached in and found a hair. I started pulling it out of my mouth and it kept coming and coming, like a fishing line!!! UGH MY GAWD. The thing took both hands and turned out to be a curly reddish hair. It was not mine nor the waitresses as it had obviously been cooked into the pancake. This made me sick to my stomach, of course.\n\nI called the waitress over and showed her. She quickly told me the hair did not match anyone on duty (WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? THE DAMN THING WAS IN MY FOOD!) She asked me if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said no, please just take this food away from the table. She did not ask me if I wanted a replacement (even though I would have said no, it would have been nice if she had offered). She came back to the table a few minutes later and picked up the $54 check, leaving another in its place. I thought maybe she had took my meal off of the bill but NO - now my total was $63.89. Listed as a service charge was $7.73 - she had included her own gratuity after the hair was found. \n\nIHOP used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant but now it just makes my stomach churn and brings back a memory I cannot erase. I will never, ever return to this restaurant and unless something changes in the future, I will never eat at another IHOP err... IHAIR again!!!  \n\nAnd since when did IHOP start adding gratuity into their checks?????????????????","date":1407703384000}

Now, the Tennessee tavern fries ... Sweet potato fries with a touch of cinnamon and sugar, with jalape\u00f1o ketchup. Shut the front door, these were to die for. Light and airy, arrived in a mini frying basket with abundant portions. The ketchup was amazing, and I definitely asked for more.

So please, if you're having a bad day, don't take it out on the customers.\n\nIf you want coffee, I would go across the street to Starbucks or down the road to PJ's, but if you don't mind average coffee then you can stick to the bakery.","date":1338248384000}

As far as hotel connected restaurants go, this place isn't too bad at all. They have a very nice setup, with sections far enough apart so that the restaurant isn't overly loud when the bar is busy. The staff are usually very friendly, and keep your drinks filled. The place has a great atmosphere and can be a good spot to catch a ball game. Some of there specials are tempting, especially when they have half priced starters.\n\nThe food here is about what you would expect. Efficient, hot, served quickly but nothing that will knock your socks off. I'd recommend the burgers and just about any of the fried dishes. Most of the starters are good, especially the wings. The BBQ is passable, but nothing to get excited for. Certainly aren't many good alternatives for BBQ in the area, so this place could definitely do the trick. Just please beware that if you're dining with a large party, your BBQ will likely be a bit on the dry side by the time it comes out, happened on multiple occasions. If you're there with just one or two other people, then you won't have to worry.\n\nBottom line is that if you're staying at the Holiday Inn that this is connected to, you can get a decent meal, some good drinks with a nice atmosphere. Good without being great, but never slid into bad territory. I'd probably lean closer to 3.5 Stars, but not higher than that.","date":1349724135000}

A few popped up in the search and I decided to try my luck at Scrubby's. It has a fun name, after all.\n\nMy first visit was on a Wednesday night after work. Parking lot was small but there were a few spaces available. When I first entered there were several people milling about, though none approached me so I wasn't sure if any were employees. The layout was as such: dryers lined the back and left side walls, rows of washers took up the center. Folding tables were scattered between the washers and laundry carts were interspersed throughout. The walls (both interior and exterior) were decorated in whimsical paintings and neon lights in shapes of bubbles and clotheslines, which was a cute touch.\n\nI walked to the second row and tried to find an open washer. There were plenty, but what I quickly realized was that nearly all of the $1.25 washers were \"out of order,\" while the $1.75 were all working. Convenient. I loaded up two machines. They were good sizes and easily fit all of my items. Washes took just under 30 mins, so ran over to Albertson's across the street to grab a sandwich for dinner. Once I was back, I loaded my stuff in two dryers. Cost is $0.25\/7 minutes for regular size, $0.25\/4 minutes for XL dryers. You have options of high, permanent press, and low heat. The regulars worked well; one dryer needed 3 cycles, the other 4. I used permanent press.\n\nOverall a decent laundromat. They have wifi which was a nice way to kill some time waiting. It was relatively clean and odor free, though the constant barrage of flies can be really annoying. And while I wasn't approached by anyone, a girl did eventually make her way to another customer who needed help. Note: they have coin machines to make change but no ATM. Go to Albertson's for that, or come prepared with cash. Scrubby's also has a drop-and-go service that might be worth pursuing if that's your thing. And they have a loyalty card that gives you $1.50 in cash after 6 visits. Be sure to ask for one. I would use this place again, and in fact did so on a Friday afternoon with a similar experience, though with the addition of Maury paternity tests on TV. On that visit I noticed they had repaired a few of the $1.25 machines, which is the reason I bumped my original 3 star review to 4. Maybe it wasn't a scam after all.","date":1446773181000}

New Orleans is my husband and my favorite vacation city and we miss the food so much when we come home.  Someone suggested we try this place and it's quickly becoming a favorite!\n\nHere's what we've tried so far:\nJambalaya- awesome!  Great heat, rice consistancy was perfect (a peeve of mine).  Exactly how i like it!  Unfortunately, the hubby isn't into jambalaya, so we don't order it often.  \nRed beans and rice- traditional & delicious\nBrisket Gumbo- so tender, smokey, ridiculously good.  \nMuffaletta- this is one thing that you typically cannot find outside of NOLA.  Many places do their own variation, but the bread and the olive salad makes the dish.  I had heard that Serpes bakes rolls specifically for their muffs and I had to try it.  Spot on!  Love it, love it!\nCafe au lait- mmmmm\nBeignets- this is the only thing I'd pass on.  Very good, but made with cinnamon with isn't my thing.\n\nI always get take out and he packs everything for easy microwaving or reheating.","date":1255613729000}

This time we didn't stop with our old standbys.   We ordered Mac n Cheese, Goat Cheese, Calamari, Crab Cake, and Egg Rolls.  What I love about this place is it's clear that nothing is pre-made because it arrives at our table looking fresh and alive.  Colors and aroma hit you the minute it lands on the table.  So popular with locals, the bar has 6 single diners chatting and feeling comfortable and clearly enjoying eating a meal they thought were eating alone. The overall feeling we get when we come here is - home.   Comfortable asking questions on menu and recommendations.  When paring wine with food, they are not shy in making alternative suggestions.   This alone makes us want to come back.  Service, in my opinion, is the key to forgiveness and LOYALTY.  The food has been consistent and a delight each time.   Tonight in particular if We had to pick a favorite - we can't.  We are arguing over each of our favorites and we can pick a winner among four adults.

I do prefer sports bars with a less corporate feel, something more like Ferg's is downtown St. Pete. The menu did look fascinating, and while the food was not too expensive, it did seem a bit pricy for being bar food.\n\nOverall this is a decent sport bar and everything was A-OK.

My friend scheduled this tour in advance for my group of 5 our first night staying in the French quarter. Out of all the things I was told to do in NOLA, going on a haunted tour was the top of our list! We met the tour guide on the corner of a busy area outside a small grocery store. The only thing I might say that was confusing was the other groups that were doing a haunted tour the same time we were and were meeting in the same vicinity. We approached the other group by accident and said we were there for the 5 in 1 tour, the man who for the other tour company told us we were in the wrong place and made very negative comments about our tour guide and the company we had signed up for. Honestly it just made HIS company look bad that he would say that to someone. \n\nAnywho, the tour was awesome-not going to give any of it away because the stories are best told by the Bone Lady herself. She was so animated and knowledgeable and while other reviewers have said negative comments about the tour, they probably just weren't paying attention (which is hard to do on a Friday night in the French quarter) \n\nAt the very end of the tour our group approached the bone lady to tell her how much we enjoyed the tour, she told us about her cemetery tour which was taking place on Sunday. We signed up with her right then and there! SERIOUSLY go on both of these tours, you won't regret it! \n\nOne more comment about the negative reviews, you'll notice a couple people say it's boring: it's not! It's a 5 in 1 tour that lasts 2 hours, there's a TON of history to go over and if you're chatting or not paying attention you will miss all of the stories!","date":1457331395000}

We chose a table behind the bar so we could watch the football game. Jeff came over to tell us about the late night happy hour and the dinner specials.\n\nHe was very attentive.

It was so much food we didn't know where to start. I started with the crawfish spring rolls and be the deviled eggs. The spring rolls were absolutely delicious. I've never had crawfish before but this roll definitely did it justice.\n\nThe deviled eggs were plentiful and the presentation was beautiful.  I'm not a fan of capers so I removed them but the egg overall was very tasty.\n\nThe gumbo arrived piping hot and came with 2 slices of bread. It was so good but I had gotten full off of the spring roll and deviled egg so I only ate a couple of spoonfuls. Not to worry, bae finished the rest.\n\nWe didn't get to the wings. Jeff was nice enough to wrap them to go.\n\nWe were given the bread pudding as a birthday dessert. It arrived warm, deep fried and delicious. Maybe the best bread pudding I've had.\n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're in the area. Next time I will do brunch. Great service, food and ambiance.","date":1537850106000}

I will first state the positives. The flavors of the curries and other stews are simply delicious; they are doing everything right with what seemed like very authentic tastes and aromas. Now here is my particular issue: this restaurant chooses to curry salmon. It is my fault, really, as I should have asked what fish was to be used in the curry fish dish. Had I known it was salmon I would have passed. Salmon is not a fish for curry, in my opinion. With that said, please note that this is a rather personal opinion and is based completely on the one issue. The restaurant is clean and the service provided is that from good people, no qualms on those points.","date":1514571393000}

This place is as close to real Mexican food you'll find if you're walking.(as I do on my lunch break trying to avoid driving in that Williams Blvd\/Veterans traffic)\n\nI've been coming here sporadically for a few months. My advice is to order tacos but order them individually. (Like shown on the plate) Each will run about $2.50-$3.00. Unlike some of the \"hip\" mexican places you'll find in New Orleans; here you get an actual handmade corn tortilla. For that reason alone, it surpasses all those places hands down.\nThe four stars rating was awarded for logistical reasons. Its not \"the best Mexican food ever\" but the best in that part of the street by far. Plus they do offer some TexMex and Central American items which hinders the \"authenticity\" factor. \nThere's lots of room for improvement. \nAfter all, this is a mom and pop restaurant, therefore it bares a Mexican theme but carry various items that can be considered otherwise.

Recently though the store made a bunch of changes. I usually stop on my way home from work late weekday afternoons. You can always bet there's no baskets by the doors and need to go hunt one down in one of the checkout lanes. Shopping carts are always in the parking lot running around crashing into cars on windy days with a mind of their own.  During the summer months the tomatoes in the produce area are a fruit fly breeding ground. They replaced their four self checkout lanes with four staffed express lanes, but they only open one lane during the weekday afternoon peak hours, making the wait four times longer than before.

Out of probably 200 sushi bars I have been to, there are only 9 places in the world that I have been to that meet my criteria to be called a \"good\" sushi bar. Three are in Japan, 2 are in Los Angeles, 1 is in San Francisco, 2 are in New York, and then there's this place in sh*tty old Philadelphia, a 5 minute cab ride from my apartment in Center city. Izumi is nothing short of excellent in every way.\nAny good food starts out with good ingredients. Making good traditional sushi is very simple: use good quality rice, prepared properly, excellent fish, and a dab of some good home-made \"wasabi\". Most places suck at all or some of these things. Not this place.\nSmall restaurant with maybe 4 staffers including one in the front-of-house. Hardest working people in the restaurant industry, those FOH guys. Probably only 30-35 seats, but when the place is full, they are running around like crazy, serving food, taking orders, busing tables, and seating new parties. The wait can be long, but it is worth it.\nAll of the fish I have had there (virtually every fish on the menu) has been perfect as sashimi and sushi, and their maki rolls are good as well. Special shout-outs for the tuna, salmon, super-white tuna (don't eat too much because of high wax content and digestive issues), and the oh toro. All are excellent in texture, quality, taste, and preparation. If you like spicy tuna rolls, you won't eat them again at your local neighborhood sushi joint. Each order is prepared individually from a filet of tuna scraped with a spoon. There's no giant tub of tuna scraps in the back mixed with mayo and a little sririacha served all day. \n\nThe good food doesn't stop at the sushi, though. Their slow roasted beef shortrib is nothing short of \"oh-my-goodness this is amazing\".\n\nWe first visited Izumi by accident about 2 or 3 months ago, and now find ourselves there once a week.

If you're still looking to drink while listening to some live jazz, the bar has got you covered with cocktails and alcoholic slushes. \n\nMy boyfriend and I popped by on a Monday night around 8pm for some beignets to compare to the ones we had over at Cafe Du Monde. Beignets here are $3.99 for three. We ordered pretty quickly and were able to snag one of the few empty tables. While the service was incredibly slow, we found ourselves mostly distracted by music and just basking in the ambience. \n\nThe beignets were fantastic- came freshly fried and hot with healthy dustings of powered sugar.

Everything was cooked to perfection: eggs over medium, wheat toast perfectly toasted, and crispy bacon. \n\nMy husband ordered a \"half\" order of pancakes which was a single giant pancake that took up literally the entire platter. He also had a side order of eggs. The portions were so generous that he wasn't able to finish it all despite having just worked up an appetite from the physical therapy. \n\nThe only thing I wish I could change is the acoustics in the place.

I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.\nSo strike 1 is the rude staff in a \"MAJOR\" hotel!\n\n2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). \nSo Strike 2 is in a \"MAJOR' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!\n\n3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204's bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. \nSo strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a \"MAJOR\" hotel!\n\n4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a \"MAJOR\" hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.\nSo Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a \"MAJOR\" hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.\n\n5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!\nStrike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!\n\n6) After all of the above complaining security didn't get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.\nStrike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.\n\nAll of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone!

We were promptly greeted by the hostess and seated at a table that felt a little \"hidden.\"  But, hey, there was another table in the section occupied, plus the hostess really seemed to put a lot of thought into where to seat us.  When we walked in, I did notice group of staff standing around the bar talking.  Strangely, I thought this was going to be a good thing -- lots of people to promptly bring us food and lots of drinks, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nSo, after being seated and given menus, we had enough time to memorize the menu.  I'm sure I'm just being a dick because it was like 10 minutes, but it wasn't that busy and the conglomeration of staff at the bar was fresh in my mind.\n\nFinally, our assigned server stopped by, expressing surprise that we were there.  Apparently\/allegedly, the hostess failed to tell him that he had a table.  At least when he asked how long we had been waiting, I told him \"long enough that we were a minute away from leaving.\"\n\nSo, that unpleasantness aside, we started off with drinks.  I was glad to see that a decent selection of beers on tap (I went with Anchor Steam).  The wine list looked decent, but my menu only had half the list (it had the same page twice).  They do carry Green Truck organic wines and are reasonably priced (though it's not called Green Truck anymore, but I digress).\n\nAnyway, we had (and I can't copy and paste from their online menu, so if you want more details, go look at their website):\n\nTuna -- it's fine, but nothing special.  If anything, the tuna was overshadowed by lots of salad and bread.\n\nBacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese with the balsamic reduction -- these were pretty good, but not mind blowing.\n\nGarlic Chile shrimp and sexy grits -- the consensus was \"this is scampi over grits.  And I have no idea why they're sexy, unless the big chunks of tomato and garlic was part of the sexiness.  Or was that part of the shrimp?  I don't know.   Our server did bring out some bread to sop up the sauce, which was nice.  And the bread was hot, so there's a plus.\n\nChicken kabob (jerk chicken with Key Lime yogurt drizzle) -- with Cafe Natasha so close, I wish we hadn't gotten this.  It was OK, but the sauce was way too sweet.\n\nIt might sound like a lot of food, but the portions are fairly small.\n\nLike any good bell curve, the end of the meal involved us waiting for a bit to get the check.  Oh well.\n\nWhen we left, I couldn't help but notice that there were three servers chatting with the hostess.  It's just weird.  I think they need to utilize their staff better.  Or something.\n\nI don't think we'll be going back -- there's nothing really too exciting going on here.","date":1282359106000}

It's incredibly filling (it has 3-4 crab cake patties) and will only run you about 12 bucks.  \n\nAlthough I only have rave reviews about Zimmers, I am only going to give it 4 stars because of their hours. They are closed Sundays and Mondays and usually close at 6 so if you work a traditional M-F 9-5 you may not really have a chance to experience the magic of Zimmers, as you should.","date":1484429890000}

I did notice relief of symptoms such as bloating and insomnia during this phase. This phase includes a protein shake and some nutritional supplements made by Xymogen and other reputable companies. Mostly an array of vitamins and amino acids. The rest of the program is basically to recommend a Paleo-style eating program with some additional supplementation. The doctor recommended a formulation to help increase my energy levels (the testing results showed me as having severe adrenal fatigue) which he makes and is a liquid herbal tincture taken under the tongue. Except his office was out of the formulation and it took 10 days to get. When I did get it I used it as directed for the next month and I lost all the sleep benefits I had gained.  I told Dr. Nelson I felt the supplements during the elimination phase seemed to be much better for my body. He poo-pooed that idea and kept the supplements the same but reduced the dosages. I never got back to feeling as good as during the elimination diet phase and slowly lost interest in the program as it wasn't doing anything helpful and is incredibly expensive. The program cost is $6800 paid over six months. While I am glad I tried the program and found some limited success during the elimination diet it is hard to maintain that way of eating while working and traveling, etc. I will try to incorporate a mini 3-day elimination period about once a month though, and do continue to eat primarily grain-free, as I am a big believer in the benefits of avoiding all grain (and legumes). For anyone thinking about this program, in my experience it was not worth anywhere near $6800. I still have some lab tests to do to compare with my original results, but the only thing that was \"wrong\" in my initial labs was adrenal fatigue (which I wasn't surprised by). There are some things the doctor doesn't check for such as Candida and Pyroluria which I would have liked to be included. Also, they really sell the program as a concierge program and encourage you to call or email anytime with questions. My experience was that you got the information by pulling teeth if you got it at all. When I had questions about the lab tests and wondered if the lab tests had included a test for Candida I didn't get a call back from the doctor but rather a call from the office manager telling me she had spoken to the doctor and he said Candida wasn't my issue. I pressed further and she said there was no test for Candida performed in the original labs. So apparently the doctor can just size up your issues without lab tests to back it up.","date":1415829614000}

Being in a large party in a busy restaurant, you expect things to take a bit longer than normal. We were fine with that, given that this place came highly recommended.\n\nWe were seated within about 30 minutes, which was not bad given how busy they are. After sitting there for about 25 minutes, we had yet to be approached by a waiter. We let the hostess know and she sent a waiter over to us. He said that he would bring us all waters and be right back. \n\nAround this time, another large party was seated at the table next to us. They appeared to have 7 people, which was confirmed when the waiter brought our waters to their table and mysteriously ended up with 2 extra glasses... A minute or two after that, a different waiter showed up and apologized, saying there was a mixup with the table assignments.\n\nWe figured that it'd be a good idea to go ahead and order while we actually had somebody's attention and placed our appetizer, food and drink orders and asked for waters. That waiter was never seen or heard from again, though... 20 more waterless minutes passed (45 minutes in total by this point) and we were tired of waiting..  To add insult to injury, though, the other large table that I mentioned had their drinks and appetizers delivered just then.\n\nOne person from our party approached the manager to complain and was basically just told, \"we're busy\". Yes, restaurants get busy and food may take a while, but 45 minutes and not even water? Needless to say, we just left and enjoyed a very good meal at Coop's Place a few blocks down.\n\nIt's not often that I feel compelled to leave a review, but this is definitely one of those occasions. It's funny how many reviews over the past year or two echo the exact same problems we experienced last night. You would expect management to take corrective actions, but I suppose they don't care as long as butts are still being put in seats.","date":1483368040000}

Upon walking in the manager greets us and asks where we were from. A friend of mine, and the only one amongst us from Louisiana, responded. The manager came back with a comment about my friend being from a trailer park when he heard where he was from (he's never lived in a trailer). So immediately not a good impression. \nWe get seated, the manager tells us our server is going to be male, a female shows up. Clearly bad communication. The waitress greets us and asks how we're doing and I return the question. She responds that she has been better. I'm a server and I know from experience, even if you're having a bad day, you don't show it or just come right out and say it. \nThe waitress suggests homemade hurricanes to drink. Two of the people in my party decide to try one. They were horrible. They were so potent u could hardly drink them. They definitely needed to add a little juice. Some cornbread with a honey sauce came to the table. It was very good! As an appetizer, the 4 of us split a sampler platter.... Which took 25 minutes to hit the table. The shrimp were good. The catfish was plain. The salmon patties were just OK. The red beans were pretty good. The turnip greens were very bitter. Overall not impressed. \nFor our entrees: One friend got the rib eye, it was undercooked. His wife got a blackened fish. The only reason the fish was \"blackened\" was because it was burnt. My fianc\u00e9 got the jambalaya and catfish plate. The jambalaya was decent but the catfish was again plain. I had the shrimp scampi. It was pretty much the only positive thing about the whole meal besides the cornbread.

Blueberry cakes are light, fresh, and fruity - perfectly sweet. Buttermilks are rich and satisfying. All worth coming back for, but oh, the apple fritters.

Surprising since it was a busy, holiday weekend so you'd think they be turning out lots of fresh pork instead of a product that tasted like it had been sitting under a dry heat lamp for hours. However, wings were pretty darn tasty. A touch under done but worth coming back for. Ribs and pork are dead to me though.\n\nThe biggest disappointment about our recent visit was the way the \"wait in line, order, get your number and sit down\" process soooo doesn't work at this place. To be fair, it's not Mr. Edley's fault that the douchebag hipsters and self absorbed yuppie parents don't have enough common sense or courtesy to not sit down before they've ordered and obtained a number but seriously, PUT UP SOME SIGNS or have the bus people and manager politely ask people who have rudely tied up a table (or 3) while their party waits to get up. When I suggested to the cashier that they might have an issue this past Saturday, she said they \"don't allow that\" but then nobody told the family of 8 who committed this major foul to get up while we looked around for a place to sit (after ordering, of course). \n\nMy thoughts for Edley's 1) your food quality is slipping 2) your customers apparently need to be taught that sitting down before ordering throws the whole balance of your system off--find a way to tell them.\n\nP.S. If you're a party of 10 and looking to sit together on their patio on a busy night, go somewhere else unless you're prepared to respect the system and try your luck for a table...AFTER YOU'VE ORDERED!","date":1401067187000}

I have never found a place where even the pizza wasn't safe - I felt they didn't have time for me or my daughter. Very disappointing for a top rated children's museum. We have visited The Indy Zoo, the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Bellaboo's, Disney World, and Sea World - all provide allergen menus and help assist with concerns for cross-contamination. Please consider an allergen menu or ingredient list so parents, kids, and adults with food allergies can enjoy a full day at the museum. Food allergies are on the rise and 5%+ of kids and 2% of adults have food allergies. On another note, the new Playscape was great except the ball exhibit really needs to be tweeked - a lot of the balls fell off of the ramps or wouldn't go up the spirals - that was very frustrating.

Here we go..\n\nThe Top Deck Restaurant is home to the $4.99 Steak and Eggs for Breakfast, $4.99 Steak and Fries for Dinner and the ever popular.......(drumroll now) $5.99 Prime Rib dinner! And I know some may be apprehensive to trying steak and prime rib dinners for such a low cost. But let me tell you, you would be shocked at the quality and the deliciousness that you get from here. And did I mention the cost!\n\nThey have other menu items here as well as to not just highlight what they seem to already have on their building (the steaks) the menu items range from..\nChicken Dinners, Salads, Burritos, Pastas, Sandwiches, Soups, Burgers ect. This place has your general \"Diner\" style motif going on here. \n\nThe service here is decent, it could vary depending on who you get, some of the waiters and waitresses seem like they get annoyed very easy. But I say \"suck it up\" with some of the best prices around you know you're going to get a lot of business. I usually leave my tips according to my service. I usually visit at least twice a day on my stays in Reno so I guess they get okay tips from me. The Prime Rib dinner honestly is the only thing I've ordered from here. Compared to big chain restaurants and my fav Prime Rib spot here in Nor Cal Mac's Ol House. This place holds its ground as a solid steakhouse.\n\nWhen you get the Prime Rib dinner it comes with the soup of the day which usually varies between..\n\nSplit Pea\nClam Chowder\nChicken Noodle\n\nYou could have French Fries or Mashed Potatos for your side or even mixed veggies if you want to lay easy on the carbs. \n\nIn closing, \"All hands on Deck\" all in the front, all in the back just like that!

Chopsticks were made out of red plastic, and the napkin was just paper, not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap, which surprised me. On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.\n\n- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I'm more so than I think?\n\n- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.\n\n- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can't remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.\n\n- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it's may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.\n\nEDIT:\n\n- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.\n\n- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice.","date":1389993017000}

He is very knowledgeable in what he does, answering everything questions you have for him. Just ask away he doesnt bite! Well not that i know of? JK.

You basically order at the counter then pick up your food. There are a few patio tables\/chairs where you can dine in as well.\n\nDefinitely get the peel and eat boiled crawfish and bbq shrimp!!! Freshest crawfish I've ever had and doesn't have an aftertaste that lingers. If you've never had crawfish, make sure you research how to open 'em up before you try 'em cause you'll be missing out. These crawdaddies are cooked with some vegetables (celery and onions) and it does have about a 6\/10 spice to it; so I wouldn't recommend it to those who can't handle spice very well. I believe the market price was $12\/lb so a bit pricier than other crawfish joints in NOLA. The BBQ boiled shrimp was very tasty as well! It came with bread drenched in garlic butter. My boyfriend and I also shared the crawfish beignets which were okay, it felt like they were sitting out for awhile waiting to be picked. These crawfish beignets resembles a hush puppy with a few pieces of crawfish tails inside. I would probably pass on them next time. Make sure to order yourself a side of fries too to sorta help fill your tummy up!\n\nIf you're trying out the peel and eat, make sure to bring some wet wipes\/hand sanitizer to use right after.

I like good BBQ, but I LOVE good Nashville Hot Chicken, and that just jumped out at me on the menu.  So, I throw in my order for a hot chicken sandwich....I was mildly alarmed when I was told that it only came in one level of hotness and they couldn't give me any hot sauce on the side (they did offer wing sauce).  Despite some mild reservations upon this discovery (what kind of REAL hot chicken place doesn't offer some type of 'this will kill you from the inside out' level of spice?), I pushed ahead with the order.  Damn, I AM a brave man.\n\nWe sit down and the order comes out just a few minutes later.  Here we go...after de-pickling it, I dig in.  First thing I notice is the breading: not as thick as your 'standard' hot chicken, but full of flavor.  I actually liked it better....seems lighter (but I know it's not more healthy, I'm not kidding myself on that).  The chicken was really tender and cooked perfectly.  The spice what a LITTLE on the light side, but still had enough heat for you to know it was there.  \n\nAnyway, I am a HUGE fan of this place....great food, full bar, nice set up inside, and a great patio as well.  Throw a great location on top of that, and what else could you ask for?","date":1435976358000}

Had to ask for it again to then receive the sweet and low. We ordered the bloomin onion and the chesse fries. The bloomin onion was not the onion the restaurant usually uses because it was on the spicy side. The chesse fires when on the ok side since they did not put much chesse or bacon on the appetizer. So in all reality we ordered a plate of fires with a little chesse and bacon. My grandmother ordered the 6oz steak and it was also on the spicy side. I however ordered the same thing but I ordered mine medium rare but when I got my steak it was rare instead of medium rare and also was really spicy.  We then had to ask for a bottle of steak sauce because if you ask for steak sauce for a party of three you will only get one tiny cup full of steak sauce for the whole table. Had to order a to go order for my father couldn't make it to lunch and our waiter said he would put it in after we had finished our meal. When we finished our food and the waiter gave us our check we still haven't received our to go order. Had to sit and extra five to ten minutes to get that said order. Lets just say we gave a bad tip.

The curry dishes are all pretty tasty, but I always go for the sudkho fried rice that has a combination of sausage, chicken, beef, and shrimp (leave the shrimp off). They cook their fried rice better than places double the price or more in town. The owner of the place is such a sweet lady and pretty much runs the joint single-handedly. I think her husband is the cook\/chef and she pretty much does the rest no matter how busy it gets. It's more of a lunch place, but is open for dinner as well. If you're a fan of Thai I highly recommend you stop in and give this place a chance. You won't be disappointed.","date":1464674074000}

The parmesan wings didn't taste as good as they looked, but it was so-so for me. On my three visits there, I had the ten wings combo (with fries and drink). The supposedly hot wings weren't as spicy (sorry guys I've had better...). The crinkle cut fries were alright as well. I did use them to dip into the leftover wing sauce on the plate. Which brings me to a point: this is probably the first wing place that I visited that doesn't offer dipping sauce (like ranch and blue-cheese). But I got by.

I dined here on a Saturday evening and ordered the four course tasting menu with some friends. We were seated promptly and the service was great. I ordered the fried green tomatoes with smoked shortbreads and cumin aioli, sea bream with rustic bread salad and hummus, meatloaf with bacon marmalade and the chocolate mousse taste with pistachio ice cream. My first two courses were excellent. It was my first time eating shortbreads, and I was pleasantly surprised. The sea bream dish was light and very tasty. However, I felt things fell short with the meat course and the dessert. The texture of the meatloaf was too crumbly, and I think I prefer my meatloaf to be a little more solid. It also seems that they included olives in their bacon marmalade and the taste of the marmalade was just too vinegary for me. And as for the dessert, it was just ok. I was able to taste the other desserts my friends ordered, and I was not really impressed by them, either. Also of note, almost every dish that came out was liberally garnished with dill-not that I mind dill, but after the third course, that was a lot of dill. Overall, it was a good meal.

Plus, 1\/2 price wine Mon-Thurs did not disappoint.  The selection was just right.\n\nWe found street parking as the lot was full, and at 7pm waited a bit for a table as they don't accept reservations for parties of less than 6.\n\nTo start, we ordered the Escargot, and it came from the kitchen screaming hot. So hot, the cheese had broken. I was looking forward to the crunchy brown bits to munch on but only had a couple of small bits that survived.  As a celiac, I couldn't dunk for the garlic butter, and they didn't bring any bits for my dining companion to dunk after I had finished.  Our server was MORE than helpful, we could have asked, but wondered if this was how it was usually served.\n\nNext I ordered the daily special - squid, mussels and shrimp with a garlic butter sauce and gluten free penne corn pasta.  I'm not usually a fan of a single ingredient gluten free pasta - corn tends to be a bit dry and fussy.  Tonight was not much of an exception.  \n\nTasty? Oh my YES. But again, without (gluten free) bread or bun to soak up that beautiful garlic butter sauce - a bit sad.  The seafood was cooked to perfection, and I don't get to say that very often.  The penne... well, stab it with a fork and some broke in half. A large spoon would have been a great addition to the dish for scooping.  I think I managed OK, because I ate almost all of it and forgot to take pictures!\n\nMy dining companions all finished their meals and had desserts which looked fantastic - tiramisu was beautiful and large! Some would share it, but for others, it's just right. \n\nBe prepared to leave by 9:30pm on a Thursday, as the cleaners apparently come soon after! (I've never heard that before, but...Ok.)\n\nNot every establishment can handle gluten free ingredients or diners, but they did well.  They weren't certain if the gelato was safe, and probably cross-contamination from others might be an issue, so good call by our waitress.  I'm looking forward to the single serving packages of buns from certain gluten free bakers (wink wink) that might make it easier for restaurants to thaw only one at a time (yes, you have to keep them frozen until serving - they get dried out, inedible and gross pre-thawed).\n\nI believe we will return to try more items on their menu.","date":1524855861000}

My sister is a vegetarian and often has a hard time finding good options when we go out, so she was delighted to see a variety of great choices (the mushroom empanadas were her favorite!). \n\nThe service was really great--the waiter was really helpful in helping us pick out beers\/cocktails (try the sangria!). Great restaurant!","date":1482194029000}

I also gave them props for the fact that even their sodas and condiments didn't have HFCS or artificial ingredients. I was disappointed that the value of the meal seems a little lackluster, being quite pricey for what you get.\n\nI have to knock this original review from 4 stars to 3 stars though because b.good is consistently slow in getting your food ready for you and the friendliness of the service is typically iffy, depending on who's serving you though. And yes, I know you can do online ordering to help with the wait times but as far as I'm concerned, there's no reason why you should have to do online ordering for 'fast food'.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, b.good is trying to market themselves as real fast food. The food is real, but it's definitely not fast, and I don't know if it warrants the prices they're charging with the service they provide. That and considering how there are so many awesome\/similar eateries in that shopping center already (like Zoes Kitchen, Chipotle, & Panera Bread), it's hard for me to keep b.good at a 4 star.","date":1418870430000}

This means you've got two options, AutoNation or Crown. Based upon personal experience (this happened to both my brother and husband), if you head to AutoNation first, you'll probably find yourself purchasing from Crown. Here's why. \n\nFrom Service to Sales, They're There to Help.\nIronically, I was helping Mom clean her three-year-old CRV interior. Her New York-dealership lease was up in two months (she moved here two years ago and needed to find a new trusted Honda dealership). Once the interior seats were clean, we were ready to hit the car wash. Boom. The three-year old battery died leaving us stuck in my driveway.\n\nHonda roadside assistance towed the car to the dealership - at no charge of course. Crown offered to replace the battery for free allowing her time to think about her next move. Regardless, I was confident we'd roll out in a new Honda, but didn't want her to worry. She's dealt with Michelle and Brooks in service several times and knows they're both awesome, so having had positive experiences with them helped.\n\nNo Real Pressure. No Real Up-Sell.\nKaren handled our lease deal with management assistance from Vinny. She listened and understood that Mom, a senior, is far from tech savvy - bells and whistles scare her. Mom no longer deals with ice and snow - no need for four-wheel drive and needs to feel comfortable on the road. Her previously-leased 2012 Civic was too tight and too low to the ground. With all of this in mind, they set her up with a standard-feature H-RV crossover vehicle to reach her price point, style and comfort requirements. \n\nJustin Simplifies the Finance Process\nYou've found your ideal car thanks to Sales, now it's time to pay up. Oy, the stress, right? No. Justin puts you at ease with humor, warmth, and banter knowing the stress involved in coughing up the cash. When we told tell him Mom obviously didn't need a top-of-the line coverage plan on a leased car, but only trusts the dealership for service, he worked with her...\n\nReady to Rock and Roll\nRegardless of the dealership closing in thirty minutes, Karen sat with us in Mom's new H-RV and walked her through each and every feature. From actually setting up and testing her iPhone speed dial numbers via bluetooth, to setting up her quick-find favorite soft rock radio stations - every question was answered. I've had this with Volkswagen, but Mom said she's never experienced that with Honda. \n\nOverall Positive Customer Experience \nWe left feeling great about the purchase. We liked getting to know the staffs' personal background - where they're from, details about their families, etc. Enjoyed complimentary cups of tea, coffee, cocoa, and bottled water - car shopping is serious business. We were there for four hours - keeping hydrated is key. Another reviewer said they make you feel like family and honestly, they did. \n\nSweet Sidenote\nCrown apparently loves animals. While out on the lot, we had the pleasure of meeting Oliver, a local orange and white outdoor-cat. Though his owner lives near the dealership, Oliver's made Crown his second home and the crew doesn't seem to mind sharing the outdoor space with him one bit. Loved this!","date":1516566890000}

A suggestion I have would be to allow fractions of slices so people can try multiple different cakes.\n\nMy wife loves chocolate and I love all sweets so we opted for the famous chocolate cake. There was so much great chocolate flavor and for the most part, the cake was super moist. It seemed like the edges of the cake might have been a little over cooked\/on the dryer side but the flavor was delightful!","date":1473125085000}

There is a ton to choose from, even if you're vegetarian.  \nFormalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.\nAn early arrival on a Sunday found the place quiet, with maybe 10 or so people dining.  No problem getting a table for 2.  We started the evening off with some garlic Naan.  Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty. \nEntrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma.  We elected \"spicy\" as our seasoning level.  I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness.  But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived!  We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire.  Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through.  The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess.\nI'm intrigued enough to return for more offerings.

Long story short - I received AWESOME customer service from the Local Taco staff, and Bryan Haas especially.  They comp'd our food for the delay, and gave a gift card to return as well.    I told him the gift card wasn't necessary, but he insisted. Bryan also slipped his business card in there, which I thought was very professional and sincere.\n\n  I just wanted to give a shout out to one of my favorite restaurants and the all-star staff that works there.

As with a lot of places the happy hour didn't apply to anywhere but the bar area, which I think is absolutely stupid.

Tasted like some household cleaner.  Ick!  Once it came to ordering food, my mom wanted something prepared that wans't on the menu. They were able to do so with ease, and made her happy, which is just about impossible to do.  She was in the restaurant industry for 20 years and is very picky!  The rest of us ordered, and the food came out shortly there after.  While we waited, I tried their bread.  It was terrible.  Cold and just not remotely good.  Our entrees came out, and they looked and tasted good with the exception of my dads.  He got some Fettchini Alfredo with Chicken, and it barely had any sauce on it.  That pasta was dry as a bone.  They eventually came out with more sauce after we requested it, but it was very noticable and should not have been brought out.  That being said, our meal wasn't bad, however it wasn't great either.  And for almost 70 bucks for 4 people, I would have expected more.","date":1349711746000}

This was not panzanella, it was a field green salad with a few bread cubes in it.  Very disappointing since the menu made it sound like a true panzanella.  When we told the waitress and who we thought was the manager ( she just nicely happened to stop by and chat) she said people had complained before because the salad had come to them and it was all bread cubes with other ingredients and no salad greens,....DUH! That's panzanella!  How about educating people on what a proper dish is don't dumb it down! We ordered the pizza , one mushroom pizza with truffle oil, that was divine,  great crust etc.  we also ordered the hot pepper pizza which was disappointing.  The crust was great but it was really just a cheese pizza with pepperoncini on it.  We shared a lemon dessert that was quite good.  The cost for lunch was somewhat expensive I thought. One appetizer, one salad, two pizzas and one dessert, no drinks, just water and the Bill with tip was $52.  Might go back and just get pizza to go next time.

I had one serving of 10 at the start of the game -- hot garlic -- and became full because of how thick the breading was. I asked for a side of ranch when ordering, but I never received it. I like my ranch dressing, especially if I'm eating chunks of breading. \n\nTo wash the \"wings\" down, I decided to take advantage of the 99 cent per 10-ounce mug of Bull Brew draft beer, which wasn't anything special but pretty good for a cheap and local beer (USF). \n\nThe service at the bar started out fine. I was asked multiple times if I wanted to order another plate of wings or if I needed another beer. Two hours went by, and when I was finally ready to take advantage of my all-you-can-eat deal, the bartenders were no where to be found. They all seemed busy trying to clean and close -- even though it was still early -- rather than serving their customers. \n\nAfter 10 minutes of waiting - and almost missing the 11 p.m. cutoff deadline for the wing deal - I finally got the attention of a bus person and ordered a serving of the honey garlic wings. Instead of getting the serving of 10 I received before, I got six. It could be because I was fuming at how bad of a beating the Gators were getting from the Louisville Cardinals, but my wings were barely warm. And yet again, they forgot to add my side of ranch I made sure to order. \n\nMaybe I ordered them too late? Or maybe I waited too long to get service? \n\nEither way, I wasn't thrilled about finishing my second serving of wings. \n\nAt this point I couldn't take it anymore -- the game or the wings -- so I asked for my check. Luckily my beers were cheap, so my bill added up to exactly $20 including tip ($11.99 for the all-you-can-eat wings plus the 99 cent beers). Not a bad price to pay to sit at the bar for almost three hours. \n\nMy experience could have been much better, though. Even if the Gators won. \n\nIf you're going to offer all-you-can-eat wings, do it the right way.","date":1357192729000}

I've been here a handful of times and have always enjoyed it.  I've gone for all different types of visits.  I've gone for a late night drink and music, coffee and a study session, an evening meal, and an afternoon lunch and exploration.  This place has it all.  \n\nI have enjoyed going to do work or school work because they have bottomless coffee and free wifi.  The fact that they serve their full menu all day is nice because I can order whatever I want whenever I want.  I usually spend several hours working there and that is always nice to have.  Waitresses never seem to mind when i stay for long periods of time and spend small amounts of money.  In addition there is a lot of space to sit.  Finally, I can always go upstairs to play ping pong or shuffleboard if I need a little study break.\n\nWhile there menu is not huge, it has quite a bit of variety.  They offer very unique dishes, including some cool breakfast plates that are offered all day.  I must mention that everything on the menu is made in house, including their bread, meats, and sauces, which I find to be impressive.  Overall, the menu includes salads, soups, interesting appetizers, unique breakfast dishes, a variety of entree's, desserts, beers (9 oz\/16 oz) and cocktails.  For the most part, everything is modestly priced.  \n\nThis place continues to intrigue me because of all the different things it offers.  It has multiple levels and it triples as a restaurant, bar, music venue.  I can say I have not been there for a true concert yet, but they seem to have quite a few shows and are not usually too expensive to attend.  The 1st floor is split between the music venue and the restaurant\/bar.  The 2nd floor has more open space that holds the shuffle board, ping pong table and more tables\/chairs.  It also has some balcony seating for the venue side as well as another bar on this floor.  Again, I'd love to catch a show here sometime.  \n\nOverall, I think that this place is worth a visit so that you can try out the menu and explore a little bit.  It's not usually too crowded during the day and you could have free run of the place depending on when you go!","date":1361482298000}

I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask \"do you mind if we sit here..\" and was cut off. He said, \"I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours.\" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who's worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why \"that man was so rude\". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same. Again, the way we were treated was completely reprehensible and could have been avoided completely.","date":1536936864000}

I've read a lot of negative reviews here...I guess every deal stands on its own.  But, for me, nothing but rave reviews. No problem traveling to Doylestown.  Ask for Kyle.","date":1456277220000}

I live in NYC, but travel to New Orleans often for New Years and this year it was a total of 10 of us traveling. We had a table at Marche together and it was the most elegant, fun evening. We had perfect views the fireworks at midnight from the deck and all the windows. The food was exceptional (buffet and passed hors d'oeuvres) and the waitstaff all went above and beyond. Brandi, one of the waitresses is truly happy seeing others have a great time and felt our smiles were her reward - other major cities seeking solid waitstaff should clone her.

They also do not have glutenfree bread to start off the meal. Nowadays alternatives are so easy to find by using tamari sauce or amino acids instead of soy sauce.

The menu is rooted in old world Mediterranean fare, but has a slight modern flair, too. The weather was wonderful, so even though the outside eating area overlooks the parking area, we opted to sit outside. The grape vines on the trellises were beautiful and healthy and just about to burst into fruit! \n\nOur entrees included the walnut encrusted trout, seafood linguine - clams, shrimp, white fish, mussels, over bed of linguine, and a lamb kofte special.  The trout was a healthy serving and perfectly prepared. Clams, mussels and shrimp over a bed of linguine was another healthy portion and half ended up in a to-go box! Again, delicious, attractively presented and perfectly prepared.  Lamb is a personal favorite, but if I had it to do over again, I would've opted for something else. It tasted ok (meat was a bit dry)  but less than appealing appearance-wise: looked like two crisscrossed sausages. It came with a very thin (runny) yogurt cucumber sauce - not the standard tzatziki one would expect. Entrees will run you about $22, pastas around $16-18, so it's not overly pricey, but the addition of a couple adult beverages or bottle of wine can change that in a heartbeat.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice place with good food and attentive service. We all voted we would be back.","date":1431478959000}

Other items you can't go wrong with are the Soft Tofu Seafood Soup, japchae,(although I prefer the H-mart japchae cause you get like twice as much for the same price),the fried squid,gimbap, box lunches, mak kimchi,and savory pancakes.\n\nTheir prices are incredibly reasonable with most things $5-$6. The box lunches are $6 and I had an amazing one last week consisting of Beef Bulgogi, Rice, Kimchi, Japchae, 2 pan fried savory dumplings and one sweet fried thing that I had no idea what it was 'cept it was incredible! I think it was some type of deep-fried flour-type ball of goodness.I'm still dreaming of that lunch. Not all items are always available. There sometimes is a bit of a language barrier; however most things are labeled and the woman who work there are friendly ans will help you as much as they can.\n\nI always check in on this place when I shop @ H-Mart to see if they have the Spicy Blue Crab soup. Today I lucked out and they had some. There was a woman who was buying like 10 qts. of the stuff. Turns out she is taking back home to Wisconsin to freeze it.

The WK philly was ready under 10 minutes, and we self sat in a cute little table where we indulged in all the vegan goodies. I loved that they had regular ketchup and spicy ketchup as options.

Plus, their price list is available as a picture on Yelp - scroll through - and if you don't\nLike the prices bring sandwiches or go down the\nBlock to McDonalds - otherwise deal with the prices and food quality - it's a water park not a gourmet restaurant!\n\nWe will go back again as it is a good value for $25 each ticket (use the discount promo codes online)!! \n\nThe kids loved it. No complaints from them.\n\nAnd you get drinks at the bar and can bring them throughout the facility (Long Island Iced Tea $9.50 - best value for alcohol served).","date":1467592766000}

Now that I've moved to DC I hardly know where to go!  The first time I walked in, I had a lot of long hair that I knew I wanted to get rid of.  I wanted to go short -- not bob short, but short-short.  I had a few pictures of cuts I liked, but  no real idea of what would look good on me.  I sat down with Ellen, we chatted for a bit, and she soon suggested a style that I thought sounded promising.  And it ended up being more than promising--it was fantastic!  I loved it, my friends loved it, and even my family liked it (high praise).  It's a cliche to point out, maybe, but i got more compliments from strangers on my hair the months after getting it cut than I'd heard for years prior.\n\nI eventually decided to grow it back out, and kept coming back to V Vegaz and Ellen for trims and cuts along the way.  I think we can all admit that growing hair out from above your jaw to below your collarbones is going to take a very long time and be irritating no matter what.  However, working with Ellen made that a far less frustrating and a far more flattering process than it would have been otherwise.  \n\nAs for more general things, the atmosphere of the salon is lovely--very well-designed without being intimidating or cold.  I never had any trouble scheduling appointments, and, thanks to the receptionist Michelle's help, was even able to fit a trim at the last minute when I accidentally showed up to the salon on the wrong day.\n\nIf you're looking for a great cut, not just a good cut, this is it.","date":1338249590000}

It's going to largely be bar cuisine but I find it quite delightful.  I go here not when I'm in the mood for something healthy (though the Paleo Bowl would fulfill that if  you are looking for something healthy) I go here when I went delicious bar food.\n\nIf you like regular nachos, the kind with real melted cheese (not fake cheese sauce), these are some of the best you can get.  They're nothing crazy, no unique twist, just damn good nachos.  If you want fancier nachos, try elsewhere.  But here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos.  The half portion is more than sufficient for one person.  I cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion. I'm a vegetarian so I never get it with beef, but you can totally add a meat option should you wish.\n\nAlso delicious is their mac and cheese.  It's so cheesy, never dried out, and always has some nice cheese melted right on top.  You can get it as a side with many of their burgers, or you can order the entr\u00e9e sized.  And in my opinion, you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese.  Because green chilis are a gift.\n\nI love their caprese appetizer as well.  Standard mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic.  But it's always tasty.  Same with the mozzarella sticks.  Their white bean hummus plate is also delicious.\n\nThe other thing I love about trident is they do what, in my opinion, all restaurants with burgers should do, they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty.  It's baffling to me how many places don't even offer a veggie burger at all (they're frozen!  not that hard to keep them stocked!) or if they do, they're hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu.  Why in the world, if you already have veggie patties on hand, do I have to order the ONE veggie burger you have listed?  Why can't I just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option?  It drives me bonkers.  But for Trident, this is never the case!  The mushroom swiss looks good to you?  They'll make it with a veggie patty.  The green chile burger looks great?  They'll make it a veggie.  Etc., etc., etc.  It's a standard Boca Burger, which are ok.  Normally I avoid Boca Burgers, but Trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger!  I recommend the Green Chile with a Boca Burger, and add a fried egg.  Side salad and no bun if you want low carb.  Or, if you're indulging, side of mac & cheese.\n\nFor non-vegetarians, my friends are always happy to eat here too.  Popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers, the non-veggie burgers, the crispy shrimp po-boy, and the paleo bowl.\n\nThey also have a fully stocked bar.  Good prices on their beverages.  And the wait staff has always been friendly and kind.\n\nWord of caution, if there's football on, it's probably going to be crowded here.  So plan accordingly.","date":1538667963000}

The potatoes surprised me because there were sweet ones in the mix, not bad.  I got the wrong tea from my server at first, but it was corrected pretty easily.

Steep but expected.\n\nMy one complaint is that I had to pay at the register, which is located by the door, and there just isn't much space there if there's a line.

So, I researched online for some local businesses.  Only Public Storage is up front about what they charge for their storage units and their website is user-friendly.\n\nOthers claim they have competitive prices, but what does that really mean?  Why don't they all clearly list their price for a particular size unit and tell you if it is available or not, without subjecting you to a sales pitch.  I inquired via their website, but they didn't have the courtesy to reply.\n\nPublic Storage was also the closest place to her Apt., UCSB, and offered the best deal too.  With their \"$1 for the 1st month promo\" it was a no-brainer decision.\n\nPublic Storage has got their act together and are very professional.  Does the competition allow you to reserve a unit without making a deposit?  Before I was finished registering online for their \"Express Check-In\" during the reservation process, their manager Kristine called to welcome me and answer any question that I might have.  That's impressive.  They also sent a written confirmation restating the size of the unit, your preference [of indoor vs. drive-up access], the cost, and your move-in date. \n\nWhen we were ready to move into the unit, Manny was our on-site team member, and he made the process hassle-free.  It was ready, and I had a choice of several that were available.  F.Y.I., if you want to keep a mattress clean, then buy one of their giant plastic storage bags.  Their office is well stocked with essential supplies and padlocks too, if you didn't have one already.\n\nMoving out was just as easy, if not easier.  We came when it was convenient for us and left the unit clean and unlocked overnight.  I notified Public Storage online of our move-out.  They inspected the unit, closed out our account, and sent me a receipt.  [I didn't even need to re-visit the place, but did since I was in the area a few days later.  I just wanted to tell Kristine and Henry, who greeted me, what a pleasure it was doing business with them.  I would highly recommend Public Storage and would without hesitation, re-use them again, if the need arises.","date":1506917788000}

My experience was just ok. They were busy. The waiter was friendly and helpful, but service was slow and our food took a long time to come out. \n\nThe decor is a tad nicer than your average sports bar, but the layout is fractured into several small compartments and they have flat screen TVs galore, but they are not positioned in a way that most of the seated folks can comfortably watch the game. \n\nThe menu consists of standard pizza, salad, sandwiches and pasta fare.  My lunch partner ordered a burger and liked it. I ordered the tutto mare and was disappointed. It was slopped in the bowl, drowning in sauce and too rich to eat more than a few bites. The clam flavor was strong and overpowered the remainder of ingredients. My salad was soggy and too sweet. I know that local Italian salads have a tendency to be sweet, but this one was seriously over the top. Prices were a little high for the quality of food. \n\nOverall, my experience was just OK. I will go back if others invite me, but I won't go out of my way to eat here. \n\nBTW, I'm getting bored with the argument about provel cheese. It is a local favorite. Every area around the country has a \"cheese\" that's typically used, and here it is provel. Giving a restaurant 1-star because they serve a local favorite is ridiculous. Also, just because you've \"been around\" doesn't mean you are a cheese expert. I've been around the world and most of the states in this great country and the argument can be made that most of the cheese available today isn't real. If you don't like it, don't eat it.","date":1242940572000}

Our waitress was very rude and not accommodating. Our waitress ignored one of our members could not have asparagus or he would die. We mistakenly forgot to get a meal card for his allergy we had on file for the conference. She said he did not have a card (piece of paper) that would not allow her to make any adjustments or alternations to the meal. This is a conference of almost 5,000 ppl and not all 5,000 were at the banquet. A vegetarian plate could not be swiped out for the chicken and asparagus plate? Or a plate brought out without asparagus? This makes no sense to me. After she told us no, I asked another waiter and he explained to me no accommodations without a card because of their supervisors. He apologized but said it was not allowed (he was nice). Once our waitress saw I asked him, she scolded me and said she was my waitress and not to ask anyone else. Then proceeded NOT to attend to our table of 12 people the rest of the night. Empty water glasses and plates, were then taken up by another waiter much later. I can understand that they have certain rules placed on them by their superiors but the way she spoke to us and reacted was up acceptable. Not to mention we contacted AFLV and they said they received similar complaints from people. So JW Marriott please have a conversation with your wait staff, we can understand policy but somethings are exceptions or at least speak to people with respect.","date":1518357569000}

The place wasn't slammed, so that may have been part of it.  But the price for a vodka tonic my friend bought wasn't shocking considering the venue.  $11.\n\nThe music had a decent blend to please most. Even some of the remixes and mashups of the current songs were really cool.  The hip hop did NOT please me, but I know it pleases others so it's cool just as long as it's got a good balance of other musical styles.\n\nThis by far is the best club for decor in Reno.  Large floor that can handle the crowds.  Too many of the other clubs in town are sardine cans.  I will say the music did seem a little loud for me, but my birthday puts me in my mid 40's maybe I am just an old fart that can't handle loud as much as I used to.  But at least that's a good warning to the other old farts that might be heading to \"da club\".\n\nAfter doing this trial run, I'm pretty sure we will be heading back down to Lex in the future...my only concern is the dress code.  This time I was in a Tux, next time I don't know if my closet can make the grade.\n\nOh, and one last heads up, if your relationship has an insecure woman in it, this might not be the best club to hit up.  There is guy \"eyecandy\" up on platforms everywhere.  So he will be looking, it's only natural, if this will get you in a fight, go elsewhere.","date":1414439657000}

They made me a beautiful plate of steak, but all the higher priced sides I was supposed to get, I could not have.

How charming a view of a brick wall, these guys really know how to make good on a reservation for our first romantic getaway in years... \nAs this is what they have, we kind of have to take it or stay in our current room, so we take it, big mistake!!!!!\nIt is late so without checking everything, we run to get a bite to eat. After a late dinner we come back to the bedroom and I pull down the bed covers, to my amazement there is a big fat hair on my pillow.

As others were saying, the design is pretty bad. It took an hour to get out of the parking garage. Elevators take forever, so we took the stairs, just to be greeted by a locked door.\n\nI'm sure there are varying opinions on this, but I'm in the boat with the people saying I thought D&B was Chuck E Cheese for adults. Little kids everywhere. I don't mind gaming with teenagers, but there were probably 100 toddlers in this place. There's people with strollers taking their infants. People, please go to Chuck E Cheese.\n\nI guess there's an any-age policy at the whole chain, it's just not what I was expecting. If anything, they should make it adults-only (or at least 13+) on weekdays and maybe open it up to all on weekends. I know that banning kids would cut into their customer base, but this makes older people not want to go, so pick your poison. I thought adults were the target market but that's not even close to the truth.\n\nAs far as the games, I didn't see anything for more than two players. I don't know how arcade games have evolved in the past 20 years, but way back in the day you could play some with four. \n\nThe best I saw was a downhill ski racing game, where you stand on it and steer with your feet. Cold air in your face for added effect. \nThe Walking Dead game was pretty cool. Kind of weird to have a crossbow that you reload instantly with 8 shots at a time. ....but I guess they're not going for realism in a zombie game. It's just a license for marketing, it's a generic zombie game. No show or comic characters. I don't care either way, it's not a bad game.\nThere's a racing game that takes a picture of your face before the race, and is connected to other machines at other locations. My friend and I were in tears laughing at this, since we would pick out a victim at the start of the race and try to ruin their day by running them off the road and making sure they lose. We just picked whoever looked most likely to cry.\n\nThere are plenty of bad games to make up for the good ones, but overall I actually had fun.

You pick your deli number (something so foreign to this Atlanta girl, but seems like it's a must here in Florida) and wait for the chaos to begin.  They take orders faster than you would imagine and before you can say \"Forgettaboutit\" you're up.  Slightly panicked at the fast pace of it all I promptly ordered 5 sandwiches (please feel free to judge me).  \n\nWhile we waited for our babies to arrive we perused the prepared food section and decided on a fennel salad and chicken pasta.\n\nIn less than 10 minutes our sandwich babies were born (no really, they were so heavy, it was awesome!).  We also grabbed a fresh loaf of bread on the way to check out (please  grab yourself one, you can thank me later).\n\nThey gave us our sandwiches in a shopping basket and when my friend asked the cashier where he could put it, she said fairly dryly \"Where you got it\"\n\nWe didn't even mind.  We were just here for the sandwiches.\n\nOut of all of the sandwiches, 3 were meh, but two standouts were the Hot Italian and the Boars Head BLT.  The magical bread that the BLT is on makes the sandwich a homerun.  it's big, messy, and delicious.  The fennel salad was not very good IMO, and the chicken pasta was just okay.  \n\nOh, and about that baguette --- we couldn't eat it fast enough.  \n\nOverall, I won't be running back, but I will definitely return with modified expectations!","date":1508876903000}

Let me tell you why I would like to give them 5stars originally. The company phone representative person who helped me book my appointment was very helpful and courteous throughout the call. They send you a friendly reminder for your appointment so you don't forget. They give you a price quote up front. The price is reasonable. I had my entire windshield replaced and installed for $240 compare to my car insurance deductible of $500 if I were to use my insurance. When I arrived at the location they greet you with a smile and get you set up really quickly and explain the whole situation before they get started (basically keeping you informed). Now to why it is a 3-stars. So upon dropping off my car I got a time estimate of 2 hrs...which is longer than what other reviewer says...that's fine cause every situation is different I guess. Before they got started on my car a bunch of ppl started to come in and they had similar appointment time to mine. So i decided to go watch them work on my car because 1) i didn't want them to go out of order on who's car they are working on and 2) it makes time go by quicker 3) I was curious to see how they take out an entire windshield. I watched for a good hour before walking to go get food for the remainder of the next hour. Before I left the guy was pretty much half way done. I took a one hour food excursion and when I got back it looked like he didn't do any work and it was at the same stage as before I left for food. Wtf is the first thought came to mind. There was another guy working on a different car during the same time as my car and they were at the same pace before I left. When I got back the other guy was already on his second car taking the window out of the second car. How is my car look like nothing was done. The only thing that possible look like it was done was maybe he vacuumed the dust away around the windshield. I asked the second guy do you know how long it is going to take (because the guy working on my car wasn't anywhere to be found)...his reply idk you have to go ask your technician. When my technician got back his reply was 30 more minutes (in a not so happy tone). At this point I wasnt really happy but just waited to get the heck out of there. On a positive note he did get it done in 30min while I waited and watched him worked on my car. I was thinking the entire time that if I hadn't go to get food my car would have been done in 30min. This could have easily been a 5stars experience IF minus the attitude and GIVE an explanation to why the work was backed up on my car specifically.","date":1493528111000}

From an event planner's viewpoint, I was over the moon happy with how professional Telisha Cobb (co-owner) and the entire MMW team were. (especially during their opening week!)\nI hope to host another event here soon!\n\nHowever, I am also reviewing this as an attendee for the Wanda Jackson show the following night. \n\nYes, I said it... the fan-frickin-tastic Wanda Jackson who is still very much a charming and incredibly talented little minx on stage. What a great way to launch a brand new venue with a music legend. \n\nThis gorgeously executed venue is massive with over 14,000 square feet of event space that can accommodate around 1500 standing attendees. The design layout is very thoughtful with 2 bar and restroom areas (on both Yelp Helps and Wanda Jackson, there was never more than a few person wait for the ladies loo. Shocking, right?) I also very much appreciate the front box-office area that is open at specific times for consumers to purchase tickets and avoid the sometimes highway robbery that is known as the ticket processing business. Ample free parking on the street and available secure parking lot spots are also available for a reasonable $5. \nThe icing on the cake for me is the coat check area. Ladies, you know what I mean... the worst thing ever is to attend a concert or event and have to drag your parka around like Linus's blankie the whole dang night... our husbands and boyfriends have had enough.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to make your way to the VIP Mezzanine, the view overlooking the stage and entire venue is quite splendid too. \n\nAs some of you know, I am a huge advocate for charitable causes and MMW is committed to making a difference in this arena. Their participation in Yelp Helps was impressive but they don't just stop there...each month MMW will spotlight one local nonprofit organization and collect items and donations at the front entrance during events and shows. To entice attendees to give, they will collect email addresses from those who do to register them for ticket-giveaways at the end of the month. Nurses For Newborns are the current beneficiary. \n\nFor all of you musicians, the state of the art sound system is music to your fan's ears while you entertain us on the over-sized stage which can be seen clearly from any angle in the crowd. I was also impressed with the artist's quarters that include 3 dressing rooms with a full bath area. As a dame who has been stuck in more than a few shotty \"green rooms\" in my lifetime, the accommodations here are like The Ritz Carlton compared to the grime that you all are used to in small to midsized venues.\n\nI'm looking forward to supporting this venue and the emerging Marathon Village neighborhood in any way that I can.","date":1322691516000}

We sat at the small 12 person bar and it took awhile for someone to take our drink order as there was only one bartender on a Saturday night. About 5-6 servers did say hi to us though. Drinks were fine. Apps came out which was the shrimp cocktail and meatballs. Meatballs were under cooked shrimp cocktail was fine. I ordered the chefs cut 20oz bone in ribeye with a chili rub and the wife ordered the filet with one of their toppings of cheese and peppers. The ribeye came out on a cold plate so I sent it back and the manager came over and apologized profusely. The best thing about the wife's filet was the cheese on top. She ordered it med rare and it came out slightly above rare. My steak came back out. I always order mine rare at steak houses and this was like a soggy sponge. Literally couldn't swallow more then 3 bites. The actual cut of steak was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen. The steak was bland. I had to ask multiple times what the rub was because I couldn't taste anything not even salt or pepper.  The beans that came out with the steaks were under cooked and hard. Needless to say I actually didn't eat dinner. The server came and picked up my full plate of steak and threw it away. The chefs cut was 50 bucks. And the total bill was 150 I literally spend that much at least once a week on food so that's not a big deal.  But I would rather spend 150 bucks on double quarter pounders with cheese and have to eat them all in one sitting then eat anything at this place again.  From start to finish it was horrible.","date":1484453468000}

There's more seating outside than inside. After paying one waitress, another asked if I wanted another beer.

In retrospect, I should have been overjoyed, because I would have had an excellent excuse to post up in the dingy (charming?) dining room and eat so many shrimp tacos I couldn't breath. It would have been worth it, because they're awesome. \n\nDuring dinner, $8.00 and tax gets you three tacos of your choice, beans, rice, pickled onions and radishes, limes, and a 16 oz. cup of fresh juicy heaven. I went with shrimp, my husband mixed it up with fish and shrimp. Lemme break it down: \n\nTortillas: Fresh, handmade, substantial without being dense. Impossibly moist and flexible. How are these not crumbling apart in my hand? This is a tortilla that can stand up to some serious manhandling, which is exactly what I did to my tacos. I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. \n\nShrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won't say lightly - someone's dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I'm happy to say they're cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don't encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. \n\nSauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. \n\nBeans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You're going to eat them. \n\nHorchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn't come out of a fountain, and I'm not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. \n\nPina\/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple. This might be my new Gatorade. \n\nTaqueria Pico De Gallo, come onnnnnnnn. Why so good?","date":1314244003000}

Charleston She Crab soup and chicken salad on a croissant. Heaven I tell you, heaven! \n\nIf you haven't checked this place out yet, you're seriously missing out. Go now!!\n\nReason for an imperfect review: Two things.\n1. The check out process is usually very time consuming. I normally wait 5-10 minutes in line before being able to pay my bill and leave. You have to go up front and pay which is fine but usually, the patrons in line are slowly picking out different desserts to purchase at the same time. There's only one cashier, usually the same lady. I don't know her name but she always seems down or unhappy. Which is always frustrating because the servers are usually very sweet and helpful. \n\n2. I wrote a review several years ago on their old Yelp name \"The Cottage Cafe\", but they have since changed their official name to Crumb De La Crumb to keep in sync with the dessert side of their business. Maybe I've always had bad luck with the desserts but I've tried many of the bars and cupcakes and always found a serious fault with them. For instance, a red velvet cupcake I had was extremely dry (like it had been baked a few days before) and the icing wasn't as sweet as you'd hope for a cream cheese icing. \n\nTL;DR The cafe side is phenomenal but the check-out process and desserts are lacking.","date":1426729711000}

I saw Gio's listed on a list of italian restaurants in the area and decided to try it out.  \nGio's is towards the back of the set of strip stores anchored by Marshalls just north of Waters.  In fact, coming from the north, I was directed by the GPS to take the left off of Dale Mabry onto Humphrey, then a right on N. Himes and a right on Waters and pull into the area by Gold's Gym.  This actually turned out to be the best way there considering the work traffic heading north around 6 pm on both Dale Mabry and Waters..  \nWe got there around 6 pm on a Wednesday night and the place was somewhat empty.  There were about 8 other customers seated at one table and that was it.  By the time we left, around 7:00 pm, another 20 customers had piled in and were seated.  \nMy wife and I started off with two glasses of California (Foxbrook?) Cabernet wine and a Caprese salad.  The salad was 3 slices of tomatoes and mozzarella in a vinaigrette dressing and chopped basil on a bed of mixed greens.  The dressing was a perfect mix of balsamic vinaigrette oil.  I hate it when the vinaigrette is over powering and too sharp.  This wasn't\nMy wife had a entree of eggplant parmesan with a side of linguine pasta.  Half eaten and half came home.  Was it good?  \"yes, indeed\".  She is a Tiramisu groupie at heart and finished with that as dessert.  Timamisu?  \"excellent, creamy, flavorful\".\nMy entree was the Veal Bellavista which was a veal scallopini saut\u00e9ed with mushrooms, artichokes, capers in a lemon butter sauce with a side of saut\u00e9ed mixed vegetables.  Excellent.  The cabernet was a subtle cabernet, not an overpowering one that tastes great with a large grilled steak so it complemented the entire meal.  \nI finished with a double expresso.  \n\nService:  attentive but not overbearing.  helpful and willing to hold a conversation with you if you so enjoy.  Otherwise, respectful.  \n\nAtmosphere: great, simple decorations and pictures, background Italian music at this time of day.  \n\nPrice:  somewhat pricey but worth it for a special day or that once a month visit.  \n\nGoing back:  Definitely.

The customer service is poor, the car pick up location is inconvenient and the cars never have a full tank of gas.

I have never rented a car from this location with a full tank of gas. They tell you it has a \"little less than full\". How the heck do you return a car \"a little less than full\"? I always end up filling up the tank for them because I don't know when to stop pumping. \n3. The cars used to be in the downstairs garage of 30th St station. Not anymore.  Go out the rental office and make a right, up the ramp until you find the escalator. Take escalator up. Walk across the overpass and take the escalators down. Leave the building and cross the walkway to the rental cars, which are outdoors. So, if it is raining or snowing, good luck.\n4. Take parking ticket from lesson 1 to exit the parking area.\n5. Upon return, just park in any spot and bring your keys back to the rental counter (back into the building, up the escalator, across the overpass, down the escalator, across the length of the station) to return the keys. Don't expect a verbal confirmation of your total, don't expect a smile or someone wishing you a good day. Just walk away vowing to take a cab the next time.","date":1361506790000}

The odor when I walked in was terrible. They had put a very large air filter in the living room to try and mask the smell. The carpet looks as if it was molding in the bedroom against the wall - looks to be the shower wall. Must have leaked.  No iron had to call in am and wait. Oh btw when I called to have someone come up and check the room and the smell they never came - nice!  You know Mgmt knows about the issues and are avoiding them. I'm a Hilton and Marriott frequent guest for business. Man this makes me not want to give Hilton my business. Starwood is now going to move up a notch as  top two property to stay at. \n\nOh the power went out in the hotel at 6 am ish. Not their fault as the waffle house next door had it power off too. It was freaky though to wake up in pitch black. Thank god for iPhone flashlight app!!!","date":1333085611000}

The French toast was just right. The thing that did for me though was the hash browns, absolutely amazing. Waiter was kind and was nice enough to check up on my girlfriend and I to see how we're doing. Great experience!","date":1515536337000}

I thought this was a sister restaurant of the The Lime ( now called the Green Lemon)  and gave it a shot.  Terrible food. My wife gave me a bit of her guacamole and it tasted like water mush. one their smoky salsas tasted metallic.   DO NOT GO!!!","date":1393205446000}
